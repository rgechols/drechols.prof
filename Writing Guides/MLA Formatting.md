# MLA Formatting

> See the links below for helpful guides on using MLA Style to format a Works Cited page, make in-text citations, and much, much more. Style guides are there to keep communities of writers on the same page (literally): they help us reproduce research, find more information, and be sure that hard-working writers (like you!) get credit for their ideas.

ℹ️ See [**Formatting Text & Documents**](Formatting%20Text%20&%20Documents%[20627ace69f7a94e0297f2ec81078621d8.md](http://20627ace69f7a94e0297f2ec81078621d8.md)) for more information (and examples) on how to format titles, quotes, paragraphs, etc.

# In-Text Citations:

Whenever you quote from (or paraphrase) an outside source, you should include an in-text citation that indicates where the information is coming from. For MLA, you usually need the author’s last name and the location of the quote (which might be a page, paragraph, or line number, or a time signature, depending on the type of source). See [[Publish/Resources/Writing Guides/How to Incorporate Quotes]] for more tips on how to do this.

# Works Cited Pages:

Don't forget the Works Cited page! For every quote you include in your essay, you need to include a full citation entry in the Works Cited page at the end. This is like an "address" where the reader can go to find your original source—at minimum, you always need the author, title, publication site, and location of the original.
