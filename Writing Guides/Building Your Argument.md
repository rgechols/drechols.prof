# Building Your Argument

👨🏼‍🏫 This short guide will help you structure and draft your argument.

Remember, an argument typically will need to include the following things:

- A clear, arguable **thesis** (your “should” statement) that outlines a problem, proposes a specific course of action, and gives **reasons** for it.
- Several clear and convincing paragraphs that give your **reasons** for proposing the action in your thesis, supported with evidence, quotes, and/or examples.
- Often, a paragraph or two acknowledgig and responding to a viewpoint that **opposes** your own.
