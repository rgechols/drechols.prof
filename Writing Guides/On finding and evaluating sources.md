# Research Guide

Use the guides below to help you navigate the process of researching your final essay, and building your annotated bibliography. If you prefer an audio guide (and a longer discussion of these principles), click the lecture link below:

## **Finding a (Hypo)thesis**

Before starting your research, you will want to decide what you would like to write about for your Research Essay. To start, you should select **at least one literary text to focus on**. This could be one we've read together; something from the supplemental readings (provided it is a creative text like a poem, story, song, etc.); or something you’ve found on your own. Remember, though, that this is a literary critical essay making an interpretive claim about the rhetorical significance of the texts you’re focusing on, and not a general report on a broad topic.

Try to choose a text with "something to say" about a critical social, political, or ethical issue: this will give you more contexts to research and incorporate into your argument.

Review the section [[Publish/Resources/Guides/How to Write a Literary Critical Thesis 2]]. This may help you refine your observations, responses, and feelings into more of an arguable **claim**.

Your thesis may change as you research (it is a "(hypo)thesis" at this stage, after all), and that is fine. But you should have a clear target to start with to direct your research.

## **Researching in Databases**

What are databases, and why use them? As I mention in the [Reading Texts Critically](https://www.notion.so/Reading-Texts-Critically-dd02c51fb6d047849f5384bbd85b601b) lecture when I discussed the peer review publication process, not all sources are equally valid, or equally useful. I may not like it, but the truth is that the most quality, cutting edge, and reliable information out there is not usually available for free. Law Offices pay thousands of dollars a week for access to legal records. Medical companies pay millions for access to research, datasets, etc. The same is true of university and public libraries: but the nice thing there is that their mission is to make that quality data available to the public and to students. So, to pay college tuition and not use the library’s resources is like paying for an all-you-can-eat BBQ feast at the Salt Lick and only eating the white bread and pickles.

### Key facts to know:

- No single databases contains all the information available: some specialize by subject, or discipline, or industry, or whatever. For our purposes, we’ll want to use the sources available on the TC Library Databases page under the “Literature/English” pulldown.
- In the field of English, databases are going to contain two general groups of sources: background or reference sources, and critical or scholarly sources (explain the difference). You’ll want to use a mix of these in your bibliography,

## Now, let’s get started!

Start by using the author's name in the advanced search along with the title of your chosen text. See what comes up, and skim a few articles or entries. Does doing so introduce other **keywords**, **texts**, or **questions** you might use to research further? Follow your nose.

For each source you find that seems relevant, save the citation by locating the "Cite" option for the entry in the database page. Different databases have different ways of doing this, but generally all of them will allow you to export a citation in MLA Style. Copy and paste the citation into your working Works Cited page (you can alphabetize later).

Under each source, paste or transcribe quotes that seem like they would be helpful to you. You will revise these, once you have five quality sources, into your annotations as complete sentences/paragraphs. Remember to include page numbers!
