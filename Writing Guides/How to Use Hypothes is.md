# How to Use Hypothes is

# How to Use [Hypothes.is](http://Hypothes.is)

> [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) is a **collaborative annotation tool** that allows us to highlight, comment, and discuss readings right in the margins. I may ask questions, or prompt you to highlight and discuss certain features of a particular reading: either way, part of your grade will depend on your **active reading and discussion** of the texts provided.

Think of Hypothesis like a **universal comment section** for everything on the web. That may sound alarming—believe me, I know—but to keep things positive and productive I've started a group just for our class. You can view Public comments (or even make them, if you like), but everything we do for the class will be private to the group, and you will only receive credit for annotations done in the private group you’ll join at the beginning of class.

# Step 1: Sign Up for Hypothesis

[Get started. : Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/start/)

Click the link above to set up your account, then to install the Chrome Extension or Bookmark (compatible with other browsers).

You will be given a link to our class group on the first day of class, or you can simply go to [hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) and click “Get Started” to set up your account. Please use your TC email address to do so, and a username that includes a recognizable version of your **real name** in order to ensure that you receive credit. I, for example, am "drechols".  You might use your first initial and last name, for instance—"Carlos Santiago" → "csantiago"—or your TC user ID, if you like.

# Step 2: Install the Extension or Bookmark

Once you have an account, I highly recommend [installing either the Google Chrome extension or the “bookmarklet”, both available at this site](https://web.hypothes.is/start/). The extension seems to work the best, but if you are on an ISD-issued computer or prefer not to use Chrome, the Bookmarklet serves the same function and is compatible with other browsers (and doesn’t require any additional downloads or permissions).

Once you’ve installed either of these, you should be able to simply click on it to pull up the Hypothesis layer over most web pages (watch the videos below to see how it works). You can then sign in to your account, highlight or annotate text on the page, and post your annotations to the Public or to a private Group (like the one I’ve set up for our class).

# Step 3: Join (and comment in) our Private Group:

You will be given a link at the beginning of class to join a private group for students in this course. This is to ensure that I can view your comments, and that you get credit for them (and it protects us from having to speak to *the entire internet*). The link will prompt you to create an account if you haven’t already, but don't worry—it does not collect any private data besides your email, and your Hypothesis annotations and comments will always be your own intellectual property.

## **Getting Started**

[Get started. : Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/start/)

Use this Quick Start Guide to get started once you have your individual class Group link. We’ll do this in class together, but it doesn’t hurt to get started.

## **Annotation Basics**

[Annotation Basics : Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/help/annotation-basics/)

## **How to Add Annotations to a Group**

1. Navigate to the document or web page you wish to annotate. [Activate Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-activate-hypothesis-on-a-web-page) and open the sidebar.
2. Click on the scope selector in the upper left corner of the Hypothesis sidebar. A dropdown with all of your groups will appear. Click on the name of the group you wish to switch to.

3. The scope selector will now switch to your group. When you highlight text and add an annotation, you will see an option to **Post to [group name]**. Selecting this option will allow other group members to see and reply to your annotation.

If you wish, you can [make fully private annotations](https://web.hypothes.is/help/making-an-annotation-private/) in the group layer as well. (For more information on annotation privacy settings, please see [Who can see my annotations?](https://web.hypothes.is/help/who-can-see-my-annotations/))

*Note: In order to avoid making your group viewable to the public, do not annotate your group activity page in the Public channel.*
