> [!info] Here is a short guide to formatting your text in a way that indicates the different kinds of information you are trying to convey. These are conventions primarily used in the humanities (English, History, Philosophy, etc.), and they can vary across disciplines or countries, but if you start here you’ll generally be on the right track.

## Formatting Documents

See [[Publish/Resources/Writing Guides/MLA Formatting|MLA Formatting]] for specifics on formatting your document. Often Google Docs or Word have templates for the various formats you might need to work in (MLA, APA, etc.) across different classes, but don’t forget to change the placeholder text there—I can’t tell you how many papers I’ve graded that were apparently written by “Last Name” 😄

Here are some good general rules, though:

- **Double-Space** your essays before turning them in.
- Include a **heading** (usually with your name, the class, the date, and the professor) at the top of the document.
- Include an **original title**, that actually serves a function in your essay (explains what you’re writing about; grabs the reader’s interest, etc.)
- Use [Paragraphs]([[Publish/Resources/Writing Guides/Writing Paragraphs|Writing Paragraphs]]) and indentation to organize your thoughts, and your writing. Never turn in a single “blob” of text.

## Formatting Quotes

Direct quotes should be placed inside quotation marks, with a parenthetical citation at the end to indicate where the quote comes from.

For example:

❓ “Quote” (Author’s Last Name with Page or Line #).

Note the period at the very end: close quotation → parentheses → period. For more information on how to properly attribute quotes, see [[Publish/Resources/Writing Guides/How to Incorporate Quotes|How to Incorporate Quotes]] If you give the author’s name in the sentence itself, or if you have done so within a sentence or two of your quote, it is not always necessary to include it in the parentheses (you should always include line, page, or paragraph number, though, where possible).

## Formatting Titles

Title formatting helps indicate to the reader what kind of text you are referring to. In general, what the MLA calls “containers” go in *italics*. These include things like novels, films, books, newspapers, websites, or plays. Texts that usually appear in these containers—articles, poems, chapters, stories, etc.—go in quotation marks.

## Some Common Examples
