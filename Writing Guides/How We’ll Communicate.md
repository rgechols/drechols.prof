# How We’ll Communicate

# Communication is key in a course like this one—it's one of our **core objectives**, after all.

It's also the only way for me to know that you need help, or for you to know what you're responsible for doing in the class. Find my info below, or over on the [Contact & Office Hours](https://www.notion.so/Contact-Office-Hours-cb2ea17ad0b641249bd3f6467b4859bd) link on the Home Page.

### Make sure that you can access your Temple College Email, the D2L site, and our Teams Page. There are links and instructions for each of these below.

# Temple College Email

We'll use [your TC email](https://www.templejc.edu/resources/email/) primarily for **official business**: requests, late notifications, questions only for me, etc. See the attached video for instructions on signing in to your account for the first time (it's for D2L, technically, but you'll use the same credentials for your email):

# D2L/Brightspace

We'll use [D2L/Brightspace](https://templejc.desire2learn.com/d2l/home) primarily as a **gradebook**. You'll take quizzes, turn in assignments, and view feedback and grades there. Note that the **content** for the class lives primarily on the course website, rather than in D2L—feel free to ask me why that is! You'll use the same email and password to sign in to all your TC accounts, so once you've signed into your email, you should be able to get into D2L the same way. See the playlist below for tips on navigating D2L (also called Brightspace).

# Microsoft Teams Page

We'll use Teams for discussions, group work, and announcements—think of it as our **digital classroom**. See your Temple College email or our D2L Homepage for a direct link to the Teams page for your class. You will receive a link and a unique code for accessing the page. Teams is free with your Temple College email, and so is the mobile (or desktop) app, at least one of which you should download and install.
