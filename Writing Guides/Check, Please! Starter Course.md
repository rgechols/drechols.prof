# Check, Please! Starter Course

In this course, we show you how to fact and source-check in five easy lessons, taking about **30 minutes apiece**. The entire online curriculum is **two and a half to three hours** and is suitable homework for the first week of a college-level module on disinformation or online information literacy, or the first few weeks of a course if assigned with other discipline-focused homework.

Once students have completed the starter course they can move on to any number of additional topical modules we will be rolling out. The topical modules go into more depth on skills, and explore specific social issues around information pollution.

Each lesson has multiple pages and activities. After clicking through to each lesson, you can use the list of links at the bottom of the first page to navigate, or just click through using the "Next up:" link under the main text.
