# How to Record Yourself

## If you are making a video as part of your assignment, there are a number of free tools that you can use. You are welcome to use one of these, or another one if you prefer: you just need to be able to generate a shareable link that you can insert into your assignment submission.

# Using Loom for Screencasts

[Loom](https://www.loom.com/education) is one resource you can use for recording yourself and/or your computer screen, if you have a laptop with a webcam. *Note that you'll need to apply for a (free) education account using your Temple email to be able to record more than 5 minutes.* You'll find a [Guide to Using Loom for Education](https://support.loom.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006847737-How-to-use-Loom-for-Education) here, with step-by-step instructions on how to proceed.

This usually takes a couple of days to verify, so start early if you plan on doing this. It's particularly useful for including slides or Powerpoints in your background. Here's a quick guide to recording your first video:

# Flipgrid

If you aren’t relying on a Powerpoint (or don’t need to share your screen), you can use Flipgrid to record yourself right in the Teams Page. See your Teams Page Presentations channel for a tab with our class Flipgrid page. You’ll need the Join Code that is unique to our class.

# Other Options

You can also simply use your phone, or various other recording options available to you. If you use your phone, be sure to turn it **horizontally**, not vertically, and be sure that you're somewhere quiet enough that we can hear you clearly.

In reading your script, I highly suggest using a free teleprompter app (of which many are available) like this one: [https://cueprompter.com](https://cueprompter.com/). You can paste in your script and set the scrolling speed to allow you to read naturally, just like the professionals do. Set your screen in a place where you can look at it and the camera at the same time: this helps with eye contact.

Finally, for general information on designing and giving presentations, you should review *The Little Seagull* section W-6: [Little Seagull Handbook](notion://www.notion.so/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=%7BorgUnitId%7D&type=lti&rcode=TempleJC-1813469&srcou=125663)
