## **Peer Review Best Practices:**

Becoming a better reader of your peers’ work, and learning to work collaboratively to identify the strengths and needs of a writing project, may be the most valuable thing you learn in this class. Read each other’s work **carefully**, **generously**, and **constructively**. Remember, respond “As a reader”: you’re being descriptive and constructive, not simply communicating your personal preferences. Compliments are fine, but detailed comments are much more useful.

### Once you finish your reviews, and receive your classmates' feedback, take a look at the [[Publish/Resources/Writing Guides/How to Revise a Draft]] to see what to do next.
