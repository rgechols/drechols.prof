This guide will take you through the steps necessary to craft a literary research paper that makes a critical, analytical argument about the meaning and significance of your chosen literary text. Use it as a road map to completing your Essay.

## 🗺️ Understanding the Assignment

-   You should review [[Publish/Resources/Writing Guides/How to Write a Literary Critical Thesis|How to Write a Literary Critical Thesis]] to make sure you know the goal and purpose of writing a literary research paper.
-   Use the [How to Close Read a Text](https://drechols.notion.site/How-to-Close-Read-a-Text-41934cb1b9134e109b36429610939663) guide to help you generate clear, grounded claims about your text. You might “Close Read” several different sections or aspects of your text in making your argument, with different paragraphs for each.
-   Finally, you should also review the [Research Essay](https://drechols.notion.site/Research-Essay-b9f6691175c04e35bac403e928010d92) prompt carefully, along with the rubric at the bottom.

<aside> 💡 Remember, you are not writing a general report, topic overview, or an opinion piece: you are making a critical, analytical argument about the meaning and significance of your chosen literary/primary text.

## 🔎 Finding and Evaluating Sources

In addition to your close reading of your primary text(s), you’ll need to incorporate reputable secondary sources that help inform your analysis.

-   Review [On finding and evaluating sources](https://drechols.notion.site/On-finding-and-evaluating-sources-948081870bb14bfbb2473af6291a95c3) for tips on using the Library Databases to find relevant, useful sources, and a list of the common types of source you will find in a database.
-   Then, review [How to Incorporate Quotes](https://drechols.notion.site/How-to-Incorporate-Quotes-c74c3529b1cc48389dfed900dc514cc3) for information on how to use the quotes you’ve selected effectively in your own writing.
-   Finally, you should also review the [Annotated Bibliography](https://drechols.notion.site/Annotated-Bibliography-ce3dc2f52296450aafdee3c863ce28f3) prompt.

<aside> 💡 Remember, it is probably most effective to start by looking for information on your primary text and its author. Your research is there to help you understand any (or all) of the following about your primary text’s…

-   Author (identity, background, perspective)
-   Rhetorical Situation (historical, political, social contexts)
-   Audience (Who is the author addressing?)
-   Technique (How does the text work, what formal or literary features does it primarily employr, etc.?)
-   Argument (What do they want the audience to do/feel/think differently? How do they aim to make this happen?) </aside>

## 🏗️ Creating an Outline

Your essay should follow a clear structure, with each point building on the one before it, and with every paragraph linking back to your central thesis.

-   If you look at the [Research Essay](https://drechols.notion.site/Research-Essay-b9f6691175c04e35bac403e928010d92) prompt under “Resources”, you’ll find [a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xMEPaUTFOj7w6O8YTYEcun8Q7TocmaUvfVtIIw_JaXI/copy) with an outline template you might use. For each point you make, you’ll want to introduce some evidence (via quotes or close readings from the text) to support and develop it.
-   You can also review [Structure & Flow](https://drechols.notion.site/Structure-Flow-05f5565a65c048c9ae22a1a077065b75) for a more general discussion of how structure works in an essay, and how to incorporate topic sentences and transitions to help connect each part of your essay to the thesis.
-   At minimum, your essay should have a clear introduction, several body paragraphs that link back to your central thesis and proceed in a logical order, and a conclusion that leave the reader with a sense of why the essay they’ve just read matters.

<aside> 🤖 **Need some help?**

Remember you can always chat with Dr. E—I’m here to help! You might also try asking an AI platform like Bing, ChatGPT, or a similar Large Language Model to help you workshop and refine your argument.

A useful script I followed went like so:

1.  “What would I need to do to prove that [your central claim]?”
2.  “Can you help me make an outline for developing this argument in an essay?”
3.  “Can you offer some alternative outlines that offer different approaches?”
4.  “Why would an argument like this matter to a contemporary audience?”

You can also upload your own outline, and ask:

-   “If you were an English professor, what advice might you offer me for improving this outline?”

********Do not simply copy and paste content from the Bot into your essay: this is not only painfully obvious (and plagiarism), but painfully generic. The models do not have access to your research, sources, this assignment prompt, or your original voice. AI can be a useful collaborator, but by design it is not an original thinker. Use it as a sandbox to help you conceptualize various possible shapes your essay might take.**

## ✏️ Writing the Essay

After you’ve built your outline, assembled your evidence and quotes, and completed your close readings, all you need to do is put it all together.

-   Use topic sentences to deliver your main points, like “mini-thesis” statements connecting each paragraph to the overall argument.
-   Remember to always introduce, attribute, and explain any quotes you bring into your essay.
-   You may want to write your introduction last: get all the pieces together, and ****then**** introduce them. It’s much easier to introduce someone once you actually know who they are.
-   In your conclusion, leave the reader with a clear sense of why this all matters: what are the stakes or implications of what you’ve shown us? How should we read texts like this one in the future? What new questions might your study raise?

<aside> 🍅 Often, it helps to use the Pomodoro Method to work in sections, both while outlining and while drafting. Set a 15- or 20-minute timer, give yourself a realistic and concrete goal, and work hard without distractions. Then, take a 5 minute break. You can repeat this process as many times as you like, or until you’re finished.

## 📐 Formatting and Citations

Once you have your draft, go back through and check to see if your citations are all there, and that your document is formatting correctly.

-   Check [**Formatting Text & Documents**](https://drechols.notion.site/Formatting-Text-Documents-627ace69f7a94e0297f2ec81078621d8) for information on formatting pages, titles, quotes, and your document.
-   Check [**MLA Formatting**](https://drechols.notion.site/MLA-Formatting-3e2004cb60f34ecd95cfd68a02974850) for information on Works Cited pages, in-text citations, and more.

<aside> ☑️ Don't forget the **Works Cited page**! Remember that for every quote you include in your essay, you need to include a full citation entry in the Works Cited page at the end. This is like an "address" where the reader can go to find your original source—at minimum, you always need the author, title, publication site, and location of the original. [Here's a link to the Purdue OWL's MLA Works Cited guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_page_basic_format.html) with formatting tips and other advice.
