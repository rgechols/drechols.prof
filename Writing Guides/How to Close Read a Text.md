## How to Close Read a Text

Following the steps below can help ensure that you aren’t jumping to conclusions about a literary text without first assembling all your evidence. Start at the surface, then observe specific formal or textual details, research historical contexts and unfamiliar terms, and finally, put together an arguable claim about the text’s meaning/significance based on the evidence you’ve assembled. If you make a claim in an essay, or indeed, in class, you should go through all of these steps to ensure that you’ve done the work to interpret it carefully.

## Five Steps to Close Reading:

1️⃣ **Paraphrase**: *What* is the literal meaning of the text, written in plain English? What is it about, what situation does it describe, what characters or voices are present in it? Remember, this isn't an *interpretation*, just a preliminary description of the facts. In this step, for instance, *Moby Dick* would just be a book about a man obsessed with killing a whale (though that's not quite enough detail, to be fair).

2️⃣ **Observe**: *How* does the text say what it says? What patterns, styles, or forms of language do you notice? Take note of vivid sensory details; word choice; repetition of phrases, sounds, or ideas; imagery or figurative language; syntactical structure; changes in vocabulary, rhythm, or tone; characteristics of the speaker's voice or perspective; or other formal features that stand out to you. Describe them briefly, and use quotes/line numbers to identify them.

3️⃣ **Contextualize**:

Now that you've looked closely at the text, turn your attention to its surroundings. Is there anything from *outside* the text you might need to understand in order to understand it? An allusion to mythology or another literary work? Something about the author's biography, background or reputation, or the kinds of things they are known for writing? Words that aren't familiar to you or that have a different historical meaning? Things that were happening in the world when the text was written?

Feel free to do a quick Google search or (better still) to use the [Temple College Library Databases](https://www.templejc.edu/resources/library/online-databases/) to explore this question. You should identify at least 2 pieces of information from *outside* the text that might be relevant to understanding it, and explain them.

4️⃣ **Analyze**: Now, put all these observations together to make a *claim* about what your selection of text *means*, and how it uses language, form, and context together to create that meaning.

Review the features and contexts that you identified in the Paraphrase and Observe steps as making potentially significant contributions to the poem’s meaning, purpose, or effect. Then, select at least three of these textual and/or contextual elements, and explain how each is significant to the meaning of this passage. You will connect these analyses together in the next step.

In your explanations, see if you can begin to *interpret* how the text's language, form, and context work together to create meaning. How does the *form* of the text relate to its *content* or meaning? Are there contrasts between the two—between tone and subject matter, for example? How does the language of the text produce a particular *effect* in the reader, and what is that effect? These are just some of the questions you might answer.

5️⃣ **Argue**: What claims might you make about the text’s significance to us as readers? Why might the author be using rhyme, or irony, or metaphor? Draw on your observations above to make your point. This is where you begin building a *thesis* about the work: an arguable claim connecting *what* the text is doing and saying with *how* it is doing/saying it.
