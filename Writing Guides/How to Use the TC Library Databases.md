# How to Use the TC Library Databases

## **Researching in Databases**

What are databases, and why use them? As we may have discussed in class, not all sources are equally valid, or equally useful. I may not like it, but the truth is that the most quality, cutting edge, and reliable information out there is not usually available for free. Law Offices pay thousands of dollars a week for access to legal records. Medical companies pay millions for access to research, datasets, etc. The same is true of university and public libraries: but the nice thing there is that their mission is to make that quality data available to the public and to students. So, to pay college tuition and not use the library’s resources is like paying for an all-you-can-eat BBQ feast at the Salt Lick and only eating the white bread and pickles.

### Key facts to know:

- No single databases contains all the information available: some specialize by subject, or discipline, or industry, or whatever. For our purposes, we’ll want to use the sources available on the TC Library Databases page under the “Reference” or “Literature/English” pulldowns.
- Most databases are going to contain two general groups of sources: background or reference sources, and critical or viewpoint sources. See [[Publish/Resources/Writing Guides/Viewpoint Vs Information Sources]]for more information on what the difference is.
- Informational or background sources can often be found under “Reference”, though there are others you might use if your research is more specialized. You can often find viewpoints and helpful overviews of issues on [Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context](https://templejc.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://link.gale.com/apps/OVIC?u=txshracd2561), for instance, or helpful overviews of literary works in GALE Literary Sources.
- You can always ask a TC Librarian for help finding a particular kind of resource: they are the experts, and they’re here to help.

## Now, let’s get started!

Start exploring your subject, keeping note of which **keywords**, **texts**, or **questions** you are using. It may be that shifting one or more of those will produce better results.

For each source you find that seems relevant, save the citation by locating the "Cite" option for the entry in the database page. Different databases have different ways of doing this, but generally all of them will allow you to export a citation in MLA Style. Copy and paste the citation into your working Works Cited page (you can alphabetize later).

Under each source, paste or transcribe quotes that seem like they would be helpful to you. You will revise these, once you have five quality sources, into your annotations as complete sentences/paragraphs. Remember to include page numbers!
