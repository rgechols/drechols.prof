# How to Incorporate Quotes

To demonstrate your thesis, you'll want to select **effective quotes** from your sources. You might use a quote to illustrate something you're claiming, to give an example, or to highlight a particular feature of the text's language or style. You might also quote from a background or scholarly source to show that you've done your research and that your description of a texts' author or historical context is supported by the experts. Try to provide at least one textual example or quote for every claim you make (this usually means at least one per paragraph, at the least).

### Two examples of using textual evidence:

1. A **direct quote**:

> In the Prologue of *In Memoriam*, Tennyson writes of the limitations (and possibilities) of religious faith, or “believing where we cannot prove” (line 4). This sets up a series of questions that the longer poem will set out, almost successfully, to answer.

1. A **paraphrase** (which doesn’t usually need a specific page or paragraph number):

> “For example, in O'brien's story "The Things They Carried," the pebble carried by Jimmy Cross in his mouth becomes symbolically transformed into a great weight in his stomach after Ted Lavender dies. This suggests that the harsh realities of war are a tough pill to swallow, or maybe even an inoculation against feeling too deeply or vulnerably.”

### Always do these three things when quoting evidence:

1. **Introduce/attribute** the source (tell us where it's from, and who wrote or said it).
2. Give the quote, and **cite** it, if it’s a direct one. Break up longer sentences and select particular phrases to make the quote part of your own sentence.
3. **Explain** the quote. What does it mean, or show? What is it doing here?

Remember, when citing a quote, you should use the author's last name, and give the page number, like so:

> One literary scholar argues that it is not "the fictions created by politicians but...the stories told by writers of fiction" that truly capture the "sense of chaos and confusion" of the Vietnam War" (Kaplan 44).

### Tips for “cleaner” quotes:

- If your quote doesn’t work grammatically in your sentence, you can use the following tools:
   - Use “...” to indicate that you’ve **removed** some words that aren’t necessary to your quote
   - Use “[brackets]” around a word that you have had to **change** in a small way (to adjust verb tense, or perhaps to give a full name instead of a pronoun)
- Remember that if you’re citing lines of poetry or lyrics
   - You should use “/” in your quote to indicate where the line breaks are (when a line ends and another begins).
   - You should use [block quotes](https://research.wou.edu/mla/mla-blockquote) for quotes that go longer than 3 lines.
