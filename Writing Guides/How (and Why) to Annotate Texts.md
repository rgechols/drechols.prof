# How (and Why) to Annotate Texts

> We have all seized the white perimeter as our own
And reached for a pen if only to show
We did not just laze in an armchair turning pages;
We pressed a thought into the wayside,
Planted an impression along the verge.

\-Billy Collins, "[Marginalia](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=39493)" (1996)

# Why Annotate?

Annotations are a way to practice [active reading](https://youtu.be/CNr-E8g35nI), which includes highlighting important phrases, images, references, terms, or names that stand out to you in the text, and recording your thoughts, questions, and impressions as you read. Good readers know that they are always having a conversation with the text: noticing and noting their own ideas and the things they see on the page. Studies have proven that annotation improves retention, promotes critical thinking skills, and saves you time later on when you are studying for exams (or need to remember what you’ve read). Annotating together (using collaborative tools like Hypothesis or Google Docs) expands on these benefits exponentially, by bringing other voices and perspectives into your ongoing conversation with the text.

# Instructions for Annotating Texts:

Don’t just highlight: make **additive comments** that enrich your (and others’) understanding of the text. In your annotations, you might address some or all of these questions:

- Why do you think the phrase you've highlighted is important?
- If it is a word you don't recognize, look it up and supply a definition.
- If you notice a proper noun, like a person or place name, see if you can find a Google image, biographical note, or map screenshot to add to your comment.
- If you notice patterns, like rhymes, alliteration (repeated beginning sounds), anaphora (repeated first word across several lines), or other formal echoes, point them out. What is their effect on how you read the text?
- If you are working with a poem or selection from a play, see if you can find (and share) a video or audio link of the author or an actor performing the lines. Bring the text to life!

After your initial comments on a text, you should also leave a longer comment (perhaps in an annotation on its title) that captures your initial thoughts on its meaning and significance. Try to go beyond summarizing the poem, and think a little more deeply about what the poet might be trying to help her audience see, understand, remember, recognize, or feel. How do you see the relationship between the poem's thematic concerns or messages and its formal features—between *what* it is saying and *how* it is saying it? Why does the text *matter*, to us, today?

You are encouraged to respond to your classmates' comments, too—add to the conversation, share insights, or commiserate. We're in this together!
