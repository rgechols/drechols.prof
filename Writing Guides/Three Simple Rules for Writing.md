## Three Simple Rules for Writing

👨🏼‍🏫 These three simple rules can help improve any kind of writing, no matter what type or genre you're working in.

## **Show, don’t (only) tell**:

💡 Think of your prose like a movie. Do you want to just be told in the running text that Darth Vader is "evil," or do you want to **see** him slicing his way through rebel troops and blowing up planets? If you're writing an explanatory guide, of course, you should do a fair bit of "telling": but even then, you want to illustrate the steps for your reader. Speak to the senses, as well as the mind.

## **Focus on action**:

💡 Verbs jumpstart, energize, move and shake, jostle, enliven, awaken, engage your reader. We’re like cats: we like to watch things in action. Watch out for too many passive "being" verbs like “are,” “is,” “was,” “am,” etc.

## **Name, don’t gesture**:

💡 Be specific, *always*. Name characters, places, objects, emotions as precisely as you can. Concrete details add crunch and zest to prose: like fresh onions and cilantro on a barbacoa taco, or flaky salt on fresh guacamole, or cracked black pepper on mashed potatoes. Use quotes, examples, stats, dates, names: try to use words that could **only** be applied to the thing you're trying to describe. Avoid words that don't immediately bring a concrete image to mind (for example: "things", "stuff", "interesting", "society", "them", etc.)
