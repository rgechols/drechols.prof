# How to Revise a Draft

# Step 1: Review your Draft & Feedback

---

After letting the dust settle, look back over your peer review(s), both the one(s) you've received and the one(s) you've given. Now, read back over the essay prompt (particularly the rubric at the end). Then, do the following:

1. Print out your rough draft, if you are able‚Äîif you keep it on-screen RESIST the urge to edit as you read, as this is a sure way to get caught in the weeds early on.
2. Read through it once quickly, and underline or highlight your **thesis or central idea**, any **evidence** or **quotes** you include, and any **important claims, examples, or ideas** you present along the way.
3. Look at the draft after you've done so, and start asking questions:
   - Does every paragraph include at least one example or piece of evidence that supports your central idea?
   - Does your thesis appear clearly at the beginning of the essay?
   - Do you have a conclusion that ‚Äúcloses the circle‚Äù on the ideas or questions raised in your introduction?
   - Do the reasons, anecdotes, or examples you include in each paragraph all support the thesis or central idea of the essay?
   - Does the order in which you present these ideas make sense, and follow a logical progression?

   **Remember, big issues with content and ideas are much more important to fix than typos and small errors. Use these questions (and the ones in the rubric) to start planning your major revisions. Save the typos and grammar for the end.**

üë®‚Äçüè´ Remember, you are¬†not just fixing typos and calling it a day here. You will need to effectively and extensively improve your draft to receive full credit on the paper.

# Step 2: Make a Revision Checklist

---

To structure your revisions, you may find it helpful to assemble a **Revision Checklist**. You can use it to make sure you address the major areas of content, thesis, argument, and evidence in your draft.

1. **Peer Advice**

To assemble your checklist, start by pulling any to-do items from your Peer Reviews. What rubric items did they suggest you return to? What advice did they give you at the end? What priorities for revision can you deduce from their comments? List these as bullet points.

2. **Rubric Items**

Then, pull up the assignment rubric, and your own annotated draft. Which questions from the Rubric do you still need to ensure that you've answered or addressed fully? List the steps you will need to take to address them as bullet points.

3. **Personal Priorities**

Finally, list any priorities you have for addressing in the draft. Do you want to make sure your prose is as polished as it can be? Revise your thesis? Add a source or two? Revisit the MLA Guides to make sure you're confident about your citations? This should probably be your longest list of bullet points.

# Step 3: Revise Your Draft

### Start with content, not style:

Begin working your way down your Revision Checklist. Prioritize the big things: **thesis**, **examples**, **structure**, **evidence**. Wait to fix grammar/surface issues until the end.

I often find that starting a¬†new document and pasting paragraphs in one at a time as I revise them is a helpful way to look at your document with "fresh eyes". Remember, you might be shifting, deleting, adding, re-focusing entire paragraphs or concepts here.

**Your final draft should not simply be a close copy of your rough draft. Experienced writers often write¬†twice as much in their rough draft as makes it into their final versions.**

### After content, attend to the style:

üó£Ô∏è Now that you have made your content changes, read the revised draft again, SLOWLY and OUT LOUD. Trust me. It works.

Pay close attention to your language with each sentence: do you run out of breath before you get to the end? It might be too long, or a run-on. Does each sentence make sense on its own, with a clear subject and verb? If not, you might have some fragments to address. Would someone know exactly what/who you are referring to with a particular pronoun ("it, they, her," etc.)? If not, replace it with the concrete noun‚Äîthis is generally a good policy, anyways.

You can also share this with a friend or parent. The ear is a powerful judge of language: if something sounds "off", it probably is. The more you go through the draft like this, the more "polished" it will be‚Äîjust like polishing a rough stone by tumbling it over and over again, or sanding a piece of lumber.

As a last step, you might use a tool like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) or Microsoft Word‚Äôs ‚ÄúReview ‚Üí Editor‚Äù function to help check your grammar and syntax. It's not perfect, but it can be helpful as an extra set of eyes.
