# How to Write a Literary Critical Thesis

# How to Write a Literary Critical Thesis

# A compelling, original thesis is the most important element of a successful critical argument.

To generate a thesis, you are moving away from your initial, personal response to the text, and moving toward an arguable claim. This is a **process**, and one we practice frequently in this class, as we move from our reading journals, annotations, and discussions towards our more structured essays.

## From Response to Claim:

- A **response** is a first step: it might be your own subjective reaction or opinion upon reading the text for the first time, or an annotation you’ve left in the margins.
- A **close reading** (or expository essay) might take that step even farther—identifying formal literary features and relevant context, and giving a brief analytical account of how a text works.
- A **thesis** goes a step further than that: it might take into account what you initially felt as you read or experienced a work of art, and it will certainly draw on your careful observations about the text, but it will also develop those observations into a unified, debatable **claim**.

> *☝🏻 In a close reading, you are saying how a text **works**. In making a claim, you are saying why it is important. You are moving from the “what” to the “so what?”*

## Focus on What the Text *Does* (Not Just What It’s About):

Another good way of thinking about this process might be found in the following distinction: in making an obervation or giving a report, you are saying what a text *is*; in generating a thesis, you are asking what a text *does,* and why it matters. This involves thinking through the text’s **rhetorical elements**: its author, audience, situation, and argument, and the relationship between all of these.

The trick with developing a thesis, though, is that often we don't actually know what we want to argue until we've started the process of trying to prove it.

This is where the concept of the (Hypo)thesis comes in: sometimes, you have to start with a theory, test it out in your research and writing, and then be ready to come back and revise it to reflect what you're actually able to prove.

> ☝🏻 Emphasize the **rhetorical elements** of the text: **author**, **context**, and **argument.** Don’t get trapped into plot summary or amateur psychologizing of characters. Remember, you're not writing *on* a topic; you're writing *with* a text. Literary texts often function as **rhetoric**: they have a specific author, audience, and method, and respond to a specific rhetorical situation. As a critic, it is your job to identify each of these, and to evaluate how (and how effectively) the text achieves its goals.

### Here's a rough formula for an arguable literary thesis:

> “In [the text(s) I’m going to read], [the author does something important/interesting], by [doing something you can see on the page].”

## Click below for some examples:

### A (strong) example thesis:

> “In “The Things They Carried,” Tim O’Brien uses the loss of innocence experienced by the character Jimmy Cross in order to demonstrate the ways in which war hardens and dehumanizes those forced to participate in it.”

See how I name the text and author clearly, point to a specific, concrete element of the story, and make a direct interpretive claim?

### A (weaker) example:

> Nina Simone’s “Mississippi Goddam” is a protest song about anti-black violence during the Civil Rights era.

We're missing a claim here: it's more of an observation or description than an argument. The passive voice ("is about") is a giveaway: focus on what the text *does*, not just what it's about.

### An improvement of the weaker thesis:

> Nina Simone’s “Mississippi Goddam” demonstrates the ways in which Black performers in America have often used “light-hearted” or popular musical genres to make serious political points. In the song, she uses an upbeat "showtune" melody to deliver a harsh condemnation of white supremacist violence, ironically using an approachable style likely to gain her access to more white audiences.

See how we shift focus from what a text is "about" to what it's **doing**, and **how**, and perhaps **why**?

## Feeling confident? Try these practice examples:

For each of the examples below, ask whether the quote represents more of an **observation**, or a **claim**. Expand the arrow to see the "answers".

> Toni Morrison’s story “Recitatif” is about racial codes and how they contribute to prejudice in American society.

- **Observation, or Argument?**

   This is an observation. See that "is about"?

> Toni Morrison’s story “Recitatif” removes racial codes from its characters in order to demonstrate that differences in social class are equally important in shaping a person’s life.

- **Observation, or Argument?**

   This is an argument: it identifies (and implicitly argues for) a specific **purpose** of Morrison's story.

> Layli Long Soldier’s poem “WHEREAS” depicts a mother who does not want her daughter to be afraid of expressing her reactions to trauma.

- **Observation, or Argument?**

   This is an observation. If you read the poem, this is simply what you'll see on the page. No one could really argue with it.

> Layli Long Soldier’s poem “WHEREAS” uses an intimate, personal trauma—a young girl cutting herself on accident—to represent a larger trauma: the historical oppression of Native Americans by the U.S. Government.

- **Observation, or Argument?**

   This is still mostly an observation. It's a bit more interpretive, but it's still not focusing on what the poet may be trying to accomplish in the poem. It's more focused on the "what" than the "so what".

> By connecting personal and public trauma, Layli Long Soldier’s poem “WHEREAS” helps us to see how poetry can make visible the personal impact of public policies in ways that official documents often hide.

- **Observation, or Argument?**

   Adding this to the statement above would certainly make it an **argument**. The claim is one that could be supported with textual evidence, but also one that a reasonable person could still argue with: they might say the poem is more significant for another reason, for example.
