# How to Use Google Web Apps

# Overview

In this class, you may be asked to use various Google apps, like Forms, Docs, Sheets, Sites, Chrome, or Jamboards. Maybe you’re already familiar with these apps—they’re very popular in schools these days—and maybe you’re not. Either way, that’s ok! This page contains several useful guides and links to making the most of the Google app ecosystem.

Remember, you have full access to Google Apps through your Temple College email address and single sign-on. It is a best practice to **sign out** of your personal (or high school) account and then **sign in to your TC Account for any work you do in this class**. This will make sharing documents and collaboration much easier.
