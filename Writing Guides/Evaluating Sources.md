# Evaluating Sources

# Information Literacy

Below, you’ll find some resources for improving your digital information literacy. We live in an increasingly complicated (and occasionally misleading) media environment, but that’s no reason to give up on discovering the truth. We have to think carefully about where our information comes from, and apply critical thinking to decide what sources we can trust. Bias is not the only factor we need to consider: a biased source can still present factual information. Instead, we need to “zoom out” on any source we encounter, seek multiple perspectives, and follow facts and arguments to their original sources when we can.

## A Test Case:

Look at the webpage below. Can you apply lateral reading to evaluate the source? Who is its author, and what venue (or website) has produced it? Try searching the web, and don’t just rely on what the organization or the author say about themselves. Even a quick Wikipedia search can be helpful. You can click the attachment below to open the pdf on its own:

### After looking at the source, you might do any (or all) of the following:

- Stop, and consider how the source makes you feel. Are you inclined to agree? To disagree? Are you angry? Relieved? Gleeful? Your initial emotional response is valuable data, as it tells you something about what the source is designed to do (with or without your permission).
- Track the references or sources that the author provides, if they provide any. Do they actually go where they say they will go?
- Follow the money. Who paid for this? Who funds the venue that publishes it? What financial interests might the author have that are connected to their message?
- Search the web for opposing viewpoints, or published articles about the source or its author. Here are a couple of sites that respond to this source in particular, for instance. I found them within 5 minutes on Google. Of course, we should apply the same scrutiny to them as we are to this example source—they have their own perspectives and biases, too.

- Make an evaluation, based on your research, of what information you can trust from this source, and whether you’d want to use it in making an argument. How has your initial, emotional response shifted after investigating the source?
