# How to Write a Revision Summary

> Do not forget to include your Revision Summary with each essay assignment. It will cost you major points on the rubric, and you'll have missed out on a very important part of the writing process. Studies have shown that **reflection** and **metacognition** (thinking about how you think) are vital steps in learning, and usually the difference between remembering and forgetting concepts you're attempting to master.

# Overview

For each of your essays (or any assignment including peer review), you will also submit a **Revision Summary** with your rough and final drafts. This should be **between 350-500 words**, and address each of the three steps below. This document is designed to help you account for the decisions, changes, and collaborations that have gone into producing your final draft. It is a key part of the assignment, and you will lose quite a few points on the rubric if you do not include it with your submission.

üë®üèº‚Äçüè´ Remember, your job in the Revision Summary is to show me what you‚Äôve learned from drafting, reviewing, and revising your essay. In some ways, it‚Äôs the most important part of the whole assignment!

## How to Write a Revision Summary:

After you've had another person read and comment on your work, you should look at your peer's comments, review the assignment prompt and rubric, follow the [[Publish/Resources/Writing Guides/How to Revise a Draft]] guide, and make any changes you can to make the paper better. Once you‚Äôve finished, you should write a **Revision Summary.**

You will attach this summary to the end of your final draft, on its own page. This Summary should be written like a short letter, in full sentences and paragraphs. **Do not simply copy/paste your reviews, but name any reviewers/reviewees and summarize and synthesize their main points.**

### Your summary should do all of the following things:

1. Describe any **feedback** you‚Äôve given and received. Tell us who reviewed your work (by name), and give a short summary of what you found helpful about their suggestions (if no one reviews your draft, you may substitute a family member or friend provided they still follow the prompt). Then, describe whose work you reviewed (by name), what your primary suggestions were, and what you learned from reviewing it that you might apply to your own writing.
2. Describe what **resources** you reviewed from the course in order to improve your draft. These might include lecture slides, writing guides, your notes from class, a linked resource or reading, a chapter from the textbook, an InQuizitive activity, or anything else I‚Äôve provided for you in the course materials. **You should mention at least 2-3 specific resources here, and explain exactly what you‚Äôve taken from them to improve your draft**.
3. Describe, **specifically**, what changes or revisions you made in response to this process and to your own work re-reading the prompt and rubric. What have you learned about your own writing process from doing this? What strengths or areas for growth do you see in yourself as a writer? What is your goal for your next piece of writing?
