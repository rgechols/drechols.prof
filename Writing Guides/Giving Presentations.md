# Giving Presentations

### Below, you'll find some tips for crafting an effective presentation, which you might rely on in a number of settings.

## Presenting Across Media

The ability to take an argument or piece of writing and *translate* it into another medium is an extremely valuable skill, both professionally and in college coursework.

👨🏼‍🏫 Remember that language *speaks* differently than it *reads*. Use shorter sentences than you might use in an essay, and repeat your main points or steps more frequently than you might otherwise. It's not as if your viewer can go back and re-read your words if they missed something!

That is part of what this activity is designed to help you practice doing. Creating, practicing, and delivering your presentation will help you develop the following skills:

1. **Synthesis**: In order to quickly and clearly communicate your ideas, you’ll need to distill your examples down to the strongest, most vivid ones, and *focus* your message for the reader.
2. **Verbal Communication**: In addition to your content, you’ll have to practice your *delivery*: making eye contact with the audience/camera, speaking clearly and directly, and thinking about how you’re presenting yourself as a speaker.
3. **Visual Communication**: Now that you have the advantage of a visual medium, you’ll need to think carefully about how to effectively select and present *images* or *examples* to aid your presentation. You’ll want to **show** your reader what you’re talking about at each step of your presentation, in addition to **telling** them what to do.

## Strong Delivery

To communicate your message effectively, you’ll want to strike a balance between **structure** and **spontaneity**. While following your script, you want to appear natural—pausing for emphasis, making appropriate gestures and eye contact, for example—while presenting your ideas in an organized, professional way.

This is why your **script** is so important: it can help keep you on track, and make sure you don’t miss any steps.

👨🏼‍🏫 Pro Tip: If you are recording a video, you can use something like a [free online teleprompter tool]([https://cueprompter.com](https://cueprompter.com)) to make your script scroll across your screen at a natural speed.

### Here are some strategies for communicating effectively and professionally:

1. **Practice**: Practice and preparation are the most effective ways to make yourself comfortable with your message. Write out your talking points on index cards or in a one-sheet outline, or use a prompter to help pace your delivery.
2. **Eye contact/posture**: maintaining eye contact, even on camera, can help your audience focus on your message and connect with you as a speaker. Try putting a sticky note just above your webcam as a focal point, or pretending like you’re talking to a friend off-screen.
3. **Emphasize and repeat** the key points of your presentation. This is where your script will come in handy: by reading your instructions word-for-word, you can focus on stating the major parts of your message clearly and without “ums,” “likes,” or “uhs”.

## Effective Visuals:

Visual communication can be very powerful—a picture is worth a thousand words, right? But you want to be careful to control every element of what your audience sees.

In general, you want to focus on **accessibility** and **simplicity** over flashy effects or gimmicks: the primary goal here is for your audience to receive your message clearly.

You don’t have to use slides or fancy graphics: you can rely on gestures, props, or actions on camera. Or you can walk us through a process by recording your screen and showing us a piece of software. You could film yourself drawing or writing something (and speed it up, ideally: drawing takes time). It’s up to you!

### Here are some basic design principles for strong visual communication:

1. **Less is more**: I write these guides for reviewing, primarily, not for presenting: I’d never cram this much text onto a slide! If you use slides for text, try to use simple, clear, and concise quotes or images. You want plenty of “white space” to avoid your slides feeling crowded. Also, avoid too many flashy animations or transitions: they can distract from your message.
2. **Choose the right aid(s)**: Remember, your aids should help the reader immediately see what you’re talking about. Select images or illustrations that link up **clearly** with what you plan to say, and that don’t need too much context or explanation on their own.
3. **Choose clear, simple fonts and colors**: sans serif fonts (like Arial and Helvetica) tend to read more easily on-screen. Make sure your text is bold and legible, and choose a neutral background (not one that clashes with or obscures your text/images).
