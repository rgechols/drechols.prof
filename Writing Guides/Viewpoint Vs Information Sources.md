# Viewpoint Vs. Information Sources

### When doing your research, you’ll want to balance your use of viewpoint and information sources. To do so, you’ll need to understand the main differences between them.

## **Viewpoint Sources:**

- Are often found in "Editorial" or "Opinion" sections, though Twitter and other social media platforms are, of course, full of them
- Are often associated with "pundits" or columnists—folks whose job it is to have and share opinions in public
- Include some kind of "should" statement
- Make an argument for (or against) a particular course of action
- Appeal to specific audiences, usually implicitly geared toward a set of shared values (political or otherwise)
- Primary goal is to **persuade** (or, at least, to reaffirm its audience's point of view)

## **Information Sources:**

- Are found in News, Science, Politics, etc. sections in Newspapers, or in reference sources like scholarly journals or databases.
- Take care to maintain an objective tone, and to present a neutral account of events or eyewitness accounts
- Rarely use the first (or second) person (”I”, “You”, etc.)
- Cite sources for the information they include
- Cite interviewees or outside sources and quote them directly when presenting opinions
- Primary goal is to **inform** (regardless of audience's values or background)
