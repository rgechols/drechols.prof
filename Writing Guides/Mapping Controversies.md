# Mapping Controversies

> Every effective argument (or rhetorical appeal) happens in a particular place, responds to a particular set of circumstances, speaks to a particular **controversy**, and addresses a particular audience, or set of **stakeholders**. To write a successful essay, you should start with a *topic* and *controversy* that matters to you, identify the *stakeholders* you wish to address, and then propose a *viewpoint* calling for a particular solution to the problem youâ€™ve identified.
