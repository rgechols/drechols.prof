# How to Get Microsoft Teams

# Microsoft Teams Page

We'll use Teams for discussions, group work, and announcementsâ€”think of it as our **digital classroom**. See your Temple College email or our D2L Homepage for a direct link to the Teams page for your class. You will receive a link and a unique code for accessing the page. Teams is free with your Temple College email, and so is the mobile (or desktop) app, at least one of which you should download and install.

## See this video for how to access Teams using your TC login:
