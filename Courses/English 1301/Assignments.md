## **Writing & Revision Portfolios**

This is a writing course, so it may come as no surprise that you’ll be doing quite a bit of writing. But you will not only be graded on the **product** of your work (the essay); instead, you will need to demonstrate that you understand the **process** of effective writing, which includes drafting, collaboration, feedback, revision, and critical thinking. That is why you will be submitting portfolios, not just essays. 

You’ll produce three writing and revision portfolios built around three different essays, each of which will involve several elements (including rough drafts, peer review, revision, and structured reflection). You can find prompts for these portfolios under "Course Materials."

## Process Writing, Discussion, and Daily Work

In addition to writing, reviewing, and revising essays, you will be given a number of low-stakes activities each week that will help reinforce your learning in the class. These might include readings, draft essays, collaborative annotations with classmates, participating in discussion, completing online learning activities, or reaching out to me with a question or status update. These are not (I promise) "busy work." Instead, think of them as "getting your reps in" (to borrow an athletic term). If the essay is the race, the big game, or the recital, then your weekly work is where you practice and prepare.

## Norton InQuizitive 
Norton InQuizitive is the external quizzing tool we will be using this semester to practice and develop your grammar and writing skills—think of it like taking a quiz and doing the reading at the same time. 

You will access the custom assignments I've made for this course through a special link in D2L. You can take each activity as many times as you like, until you receive the grade you are aiming for.

You will need to have a code in order to use this product: access comes with the textbook, the *Little Seagull* ebook (which only costs $15). 

## Weekly Declarations

I have adapted the Declaration Quiz from Dr. Laura Gibbs of Oklahoma University as a way for you to track your own progress and participation each week. You will be given, for every unit of the class, a quiz in D2L with a short series of clear, objective statements describing your work in the unit. For each of those statements, you will indicate whether you have completed the work described or not. This is an opportunity to exercise personal responsibility, a key objective for this course.

In addition to claiming credit for completing certain objectives, you will also write a short reflection based on a prompt that will change from week to week. These will be graded manually, for completion, after the quiz deadline. Think of it as an opportunity to check in with yourself (and me) about what you've learned. 

## Teams Page Participation 
We will take time each week to check in with each other, and to discuss the readings and our progress in achieving the course objectives. You will be assessed for the quality, depth, timeliness, and consistency of your contributions to the Teams Page each week. 

Plan on responding at least once to the discussion threads in Teams each week (and on checking Teams regularly for updates and announcements from me). 

## Oral Presentation 

You will deliver a brief oral presentation to the rest of the class, showing that you can take a written message and translate it into an engaging presentation. 

## **Final Assessment**s

At the end of the course you will make a final series of learning declarations, and draft a polished letter to a future student in the course, reflecting on what you've learned and demonstrating your writing and communication skills.
