Department of English & Foreign Languages 
Temple College 
**[Contact & Office Hours](https://drechols.notion.site/cb2ea17ad0b641249bd3f6467b4859bd?pvs=21) | [About Me](https://drechols.notion.site/c609ea8607e94ad180f6daa6ee9f2f53?pvs=21)**

This **syllabus** is a kind of contract between us: it says what I’m committed to providing for you as an instructor, and outlines what I will expect from you as a student. I want [all of my students](https://drechols.notion.site/Equity-Inclusion-Statements-08d9f04822054c1d93495fc5da1322b1?pvs=21) to succeed, and am committed to helping them do so.

If this is your first college course, great! The main thing to know is that, in this class, **you are responsible for your own learning.** I am here to help, but it is your job to read instructions carefully, complete assignments on time, and demonstrate that you've prepared for the course. It is also your job to reach out _proactively_ and _responsibly_ for help when you need it: I care about my students and I want you all to succeed, so I am always happy to hear from you. I can't help, however, if I don't know what you need (or if you email me in panic an hour before the deadline). So, don't be a stranger.

# Grading & Assessment

## Assessment Policies

[How (and Why) I Grade](https://drechols.notion.site/How-and-Why-I-Grade-6618a12426c849b99b9a7661de2fed40?pvs=21)

Grades will be taken on a points-based system, with clear rubrics and guidelines for timely completion. See the link above for more details, and for information on how and why I grade.

> **Letter grades will be assigned as follows, with no rounding up: +900 = A | +800 = B | +700 = C | +600 = D | <600 = F**

There are a total of 1000 points available in the course. You will be able to see these points in D2L in order to plan your work and track your progress—**remember that it is** **only the total amount of points that matters in the end, not any percentages you may see in the gradebook.** At a minimum, you **must** complete all major essays and the final assessment in order to pass the course. Decide which grade you wish to earn in the class, and determine the minimum amount of points you must earn in order to receive it.

## **Grade Distributions**

-   **Writing & Revision Portfolios**
    -   Personal Writing Portfolio (200 points)
    -   Critical Writing Portfolio (200 points)
    -   Public Writing Portfolio (200 points)
-   **Process Writing, Discussion, and Daily Work**
    -   Norton InQuizitive (100 points)
    -   Weekly Declarations (100 points)
    -   Teams Page Participation (50 points)
    -   Oral Presentation (50 points)
-   **Final Assessment**
    -   Written Learning Declaration (50 points)
    -   Declarations Final (50 points)

## Assignments

I have designed the course, and each essay assignment, to measure and contribute to your **writing** **process**: think of them as ways of showing your progress and demonstrating what you’ve learned. I will grade each essay using the questions listed on the [Essay Grading Rubric](https://drechols.notion.site/7e8333fee4cd4a05978916c2ff0ff425?pvs=21) page.

Every essay assignment in this class is designed to act as a **portfolio**: evidence of your work, attention, and growth. I will expect **improvement** and **reflection** with each essay: getting a high grade on the first one does not mean you’ll get the same grade the next time if there are no signs of progress. You are not just trading a product for a grade: rather, you are demonstrating your mastery of a process, your development as a writer, and the work you've put in to the class. This means that a last-minute effort is not going to replace a lack of effort or preparation—you have to be consistently present and active in the process to receive full credit, not just submit a hasty scrawl at the eleventh hour.

I am always available to discuss your work in person, and will provide more detailed, targeted feedback on request, but one of the goals of this course is to help you develop a critical eye for your own work, and the skills to identify issues and address them. I will make comments and asses your work, but I will not "fix it" for you. **In college, you’re responsible for your own learning, development, and growth**, though, of course, I am here to help facilitate all of these. Know that I am always happy to go deeper if you are willing to put in the extra work.

### **Writing & Revision Portfolios**

This is a writing course, so it may come as no surprise that you’ll be doing quite a bit of writing. But you will not only be graded on the **product** of your work (the essay); instead, you will need to demonstrate that you understand the **process** of effective writing, which includes drafting, collaboration, feedback, revision, and critical thinking. That is why you will be submitting portfolios, not just essays.

You’ll produce three writing and revision portfolios built around three different essays, each of which will involve several elements (including rough drafts, peer review, revision, and structured reflection). You can find prompts for these portfolios under "Course Materials."

[Personal Writing Portfolio](https://drechols.notion.site/Personal-Writing-Portfolio-2c1cca02fd8642298f700a6db19e004d?pvs=21)

[Critical Writing Portfolio](https://drechols.notion.site/Critical-Writing-Portfolio-17ecdfcfeb454010b74dcb09d26a7877?pvs=21)

[Public Writing Portfolio (16w)](https://drechols.notion.site/Public-Writing-Portfolio-16w-161f4543aaeb400793ce4a27de30b17c?pvs=21)

### **Process Writing, Discussion, and Daily Work**

In addition to writing, reviewing, and revising essays, you will be given a number of low-stakes activities each week that will help reinforce your learning in the class. These might include readings, draft essays, collaborative annotations with classmates, participating in discussion, completing online learning activities, or reaching out to me with a question or status update. These are not (I promise) "busy work." Instead, think of them as "getting your reps in" (to borrow an athletic term). If the essay is the race, the big game, or the recital, then your weekly work is where you practice and prepare.

-   **Norton InQuizitive**
    
    [How to Use Norton InQuizitive](https://drechols.notion.site/How-to-Use-Norton-InQuizitive-816c3a0568554bb39f09f31ab9bf0240?pvs=21)
    
    Norton InQuizitive is the external quizzing tool we will be using this semester to practice and develop your grammar and writing skills—think of it like taking a quiz and doing the reading at the same time.
    
    You will access the custom assignments I've made for this course through a special link in D2L. You can take each activity as many times as you like, until you receive the grade you are aiming for.
    
    You will need to have a code in order to use this product: access comes with the textbook, the _Little Seagull_ ebook (which only costs $15).
    
-   **Weekly Declarations**
    
    I have adapted the Declaration Quiz from Dr. Laura Gibbs of Oklahoma University as a way for you to track your own progress and participation each week. You will be given, for every unit of the class, a quiz in D2L with a short series of clear, objective statements describing your work in the unit. For each of those statements, you will indicate whether you have completed the work described or not. This is an opportunity to exercise personal responsibility, a key objective for this course.
    
    In addition to claiming credit for completing certain objectives, you will also write a short reflection based on a prompt that will change from week to week. These will be graded manually, for completion, after the quiz deadline. Think of it as an opportunity to check in with yourself (and me) about what you've learned.
    
-   **Teams Page Participation**
    
    We will take time each week to check in with each other, and to discuss the readings and our progress in achieving the course objectives. You will be assessed for the quality, depth, timeliness, and consistency of your contributions to the Teams Page each week.
    
    Plan on responding at least once to the discussion threads in Teams each week (and on checking Teams regularly for updates and announcements from me).
    

### **Oral Presentation**

You will deliver a brief oral presentation to the rest of the class, showing that you can take a written message and translate it into an engaging presentation.

### **Final Assessment**s

At the end of the course you will make a final series of learning declarations, and draft a polished letter to a future student in the course, reflecting on what you've learned and demonstrating your writing and communication skills.

## Dual Credit Grade Reporting

As far as Temple College and most other institutions of higher education are concerned, letter grades are all that matters. There is typically no difference between 90% and 100% on a college transcript: both are simply an "A."

If you are in a Dual Credit course, and the difference in points within a particular grade range is important to you for your high school GPA, note that it is **very difficult** to get above the equivalent of a 90% in this (or any) college course. **To get a higher numerical grade, you will have to go above and beyond the basic requirements of the course (and will be given optional challenging activities to help you do so).** To calculate your percentage grade (out of 100), simply divide the number of points you've earned by the total points possible in the course at a given date.

## Declarations Quizzes

I have adapted the **Declaration Quiz** from Dr. Laura Gibbs of Oklahoma University as a way for you to track your own progress and participation in course activities each week. You will be given, for every unit of the class, a quiz in D2L with a short series of clear, objective statements describing your work in the unit. For each of those statements, you will indicate whether you have completed the work described or not. This is an opportunity to exercise **personal responsibility**, a key objective for this course.

---

**Here's a sample Declaration you might see on a quiz:**

> "This week, I responded to at least two of my classmates in the Discussion thread on Teams, using at least one direct quote from each peers' paper. I have effectively practiced quoting from another writer and giving targeted feedback based on specific details in a piece of writing."

-   [ ] True
-   [ ] False

---

If you did, in fact, do this, you would select "True." If you didn't, you would select "False." Points will be assigned based on the difficulty and time-commitment of the task. This makes it easy for you to ensure that you are keeping up with the class, to track your progress, and to practice self-assessment (a key skill in this class and in life).

Making a false Declaration (or saying you've done something when you haven't) constitutes a violation of Academic Integrity and will come with a blanket deduction of **50 points** (or a half letter grade) from your **final grade** for each violation.

I'll be performing Declarations Audits throughout the class to ensure that everyone is staying honest with themselves and with us. Personal Responsibility is a stated objective for the class: this is an opportunity for you to practice it.

## **Late Work/Make-Up Policy**

In general, you **may not** make up any quizzes, discussion posts, or other daily work. There are few exceptions, so be sure you complete your weekly assignments with plenty of time to spare in order to claim them in your Declarations quizzes. If extenuating circumstances arise, you are responsible for contacting me in advance to make any necessary arrangements.

All assignments are due by 9 PM on the due date, per the assignment instructions. Any work submitted after that time will not be accepted for credit, unless you have arranged for an extension with me at least 72 hours before the due date.

## Online Work & Tech Issues

You are responsible for ensuring that you have a stable internet connection, access to D2L, and reliable technology for completing and submitting your assignments. Technological difficulties will not be accepted as an excuse for missed work (though I am as accommodating as I can be with folks who reach out in advance).

## Attendance

**For Online or Hybrid Classes:**

In online courses all attendance will be taken based on the timely completion of weekly assignments. If you do not turn in work, you will receive a zero for the assignment(s) and be counted absent for the corresponding class sessions. Students may be withdrawn from the course on their 3rd absence/missed week of work if it is before the drop date.

**For In-Person Classes:**

Attendance will be taken daily, usually through some form of short assignment, activity, or written work. It is your responsibility to be both **physically** and **mentally** present in class: failure to do either may result in you being marked absent for the day, or losing credit for daily work. Missing more than the maximum number of class days can lead to you failing or being dropped from the course—and will almost certainly result in a lower overall grade, practically speaking.

**If at any time you realize that you cannot complete the course, it is your responsibility to drop the course.** Check the [Temple Academic Calendar](https://www.templejc.edu/calendar/academic/) for the last day to drop a class for the semester you're in. If you do not do so by that date, you will receive a failing grade.

## **Academic Integrity**

Please review the Temple College Scholastic Integrity Policy in [the Student Handbook](http://catalog.templejc.edu/index.php?catoid=20). It is my responsibility to ensure that scholastic integrity is maintained in all my classes; therefore, please note that no form of cheating or plagiarism is tolerated.

If the words are not your own, put them inside quotation marks and attribute their source: to do otherwise is **plagiarism**, and may result in a zero, a failing grade in the course, or even removal from the college.

Note that you will be responsible for tracking your own progress in the course each week through Declarations Quizzes. Making any false Declaration in your Quizzes is a violation of the Integrity Policy and Course Honor Code. Be honest: take responsibility for your own learning.

## Plagiarism & AI

Plagiarism is making use of others’ work or words without attribution. It can be intentional or unintentional, but in either case, it is unnacceptable, and grounds for receiving an immediate zero on an assignment (and in some cases, for being dropped from the course).

Please review the Temple College Scholastic Integrity Policy in [the Student Handbook](http://catalog.templejc.edu/index.php?catoid=20). It is my responsibility to ensure that scholastic integrity is maintained in all my classes; therefore, please note that no form of cheating or plagiarism is tolerated.

If the words are not your own, [put them inside quotation marks](https://drechols.notion.site/c74c3529b1cc48389dfed900dc514cc3?pvs=21) and [attribute their source](https://drechols.notion.site/3e2004cb60f34ecd95cfd68a02974850?pvs=21): to do otherwise is plagiarism, and may result in a zero, a failing grade in the course, or even removal from the college.

********************************************************Note on AI-Generated text:******************************************************** Scholastic integrity requires that all work submitted by students must be original and produced by the student themselves. This includes the use of AI-generated text, such as that produced by language models or text generators. Using AI-generated text in assignments or exams (unless specified in the assignment prompt) is considered plagiarism and will not be tolerated. Any student found to be using AI-generated text in their work without acknowledging it will be subject to the consequences of plagiarism as outlined in the policy above.

I reserve the right to ask you to explain and defend any aspect of your written work, and to require the resubmission of the assignment under controlled conditions if it seems likely that you have not written the text yourself.

# Student Accommodations & Support

## College ADA Policies

Temple College abides by the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which states: “No otherwise qualified person shall, on the basis of a disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any academic …or other postsecondary education aid, benefits, or services.”

If you have a documented disability that may impact your performance and for which you may require accommodations, you must register with and provide documentation of your disability to the Office of Student Accommodations for review by the Coordinator for Accommodations.

## Accommodations

If you have a documented disability or need special accommodations to succeed in class, the college has specific resources and processes in place to help you.

The important thing to know is that you must ask for this assistance in order to receive it—I'm happy to put you in touch with these resources or answer any questions that you may have about the process. Please know that I try to design my courses to be as accessible as possible to all students: if you have input or suggestions for how I can serve your needs better, please let me know.

**After applying and receiving an accommodation letter, please reach out to me within the first week of class to discuss the provisions of those accommodations, and to make sure that we get you whatever resources you’ll need.

### How to Request Accommodations

Unlike high school, a college does not seek out and provide accommodations to students. In order to receive accommodations in college, students must self identify and apply for services and provide documentation from a qualified professional that confirms the existence of a disability.

For those with disabilities, go to Misty Reid, the Coordinator for Accommodations, Office 1450, One College Center, 254-298-8335.   For pregnancy-related issues, go to Adrian Sora, Director of Student Retention, 254-298-8328.

-   [Link to Temple College Accommodations Page](https://www.templejc.edu/admissions/right-to-know/academic-accommodations/)

If you have accommodations and have reported them to the Coordinator, I will receive a letter informing me of which accommodations you are eligible for. In general, I have tried to design the course and assignments to be accessible to every student (and to meet most accommodations)—but if you need further support or resources, **please let me know, as soon as possible**. I’m here to help.

## Title IX Resources

Temple College faculty are committed to helping create a safe and open learning environment for all students. The College strongly encourages all members of the community to take action, seek support and report incidents of sexual misconduct to the **Title IX Office.**

> **Title IX Coordinator**  Eva Munguia, [eva.munguia@templejc.edu](mailto:eva.munguia@templejc.edu) 254-298-8591

Please be aware that under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, **I am required to disclose information about such misconduct to the Title IX Office.**

The Campus Police Department also has officers who are specially trained to work with individuals reporting sexual violence. They can help you review your options and help you seek support such as medical attention, counseling services and legal assistance. The Campus Police Department can also assist in reporting assaults to other law enforcement agencies. Reports of sexual misconduct made to the Campus Police will automatically be reported to the College’s Title IX Coordinator regardless of whether the individual who experienced the sexual misconduct chooses to pursue criminal charges.

## Student Resources & Support

Need some support? Through the College, you have access to help with your writing, studying, and mental health; libraries full of information and resources; options for financial assistance (and not just with school); and much more. Use them! I'm also more than happy to help you navigate these resources if/as needed.

# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

### **************************************************************We will embrace and value diversity.**************************************************************

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your input in this regard is encouraged and appreciated.

> **No discriminatory, hateful, or harmful language or behaviors will be tolerated in any of my classes.**

### **We will discuss difficult topics.**

While I expect there to be rigorous discussion and even disagreement in the course of our class discussions, I ask that you engage in discussion with care and empathy for the other members in the classroom. Aim to disagree without becoming disagreeable. In this class we will not shy away from the uncomfortable. Critically examining and assessing our most basic assumptions and values is one of the key . I urge you to have the courage to the uncomfortable in this class. In exchange for your courage, I will work to ensure a classroom environment that supports your taking these intellectual and emotional risks.

### **********************************************************************************We will address each other with respect.**********************************************************************************

All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity.

In this class, we will have the chance to indicate the name that we prefer to be called and, if we choose, to identify pronouns with which we would like to be addressed. I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly and support classmates in doing so as well.

# COVID Guidelines

The COVID-19 pandemic impacts us all in many ways, including physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, academically, and professionally. We are a community and are thus dependent on, and affected by, the actions, precautions, and protections each of us takes to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. My home, for example, is connected not only to all of you in this classroom, but also to the hundreds of children that my spouse, a school librarian, works with every day. As such, I ask that you take reasonable efforts to protect yourselves, our campus, and our broader community from the spread of COVID-19.

> **All students are expected to follow the guidance provided by the College with regard to COVID-19 precautions, masks, and vaccinations.**

If you are sick, particularly with any symptoms of COVID-19, do not come to class. I will work with you to make sure you have the opportunity to learn the material you missed because of an illness.

-   On Absences
    
    In the recognition that many of us will face challenges related to the pandemic this semester, I have designed the course with as much online content and discussion as possible. In class, we will still use online tools to discuss, read, annotate, and write together. This is not only to facilitate greater participation from all of us: it is also to make it as easy as possible for someone who must stay home due to the virus to keep up, if possible. If you are ill, or have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, **please do not come to class**. Reach out to me to discuss your options, and I will be more than happy to provide them for you.
    
-   On Pivoting/Changing Modalities
    
    This course has been designed to transition to fully online, should the need arise due to tightening local, state, or federal guidelines or campus closure. To that end, several online platforms will be used to support this course. Regardless of class modality, student work shall be turned in digitally. We will conduct discussions, quizzes, lectures, and peer review both online and in-person—it is imperative that students keep track of announcements and discussions in Teams, prompts and schedules on the course website, and quizzes and essay submissions in D2L.

Materials used in this class, including but not limited to lectures, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets, may not be shared online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my explicit, written permission.

Class recordings and discussions are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes, and are protected under FERPA, and must not be shared with anyone outside the class in any form. Any exceptions to this policy will be indicated as needed.

## **Active Participation**

Whether you are in person or online, you are expected to participate **actively** and **thoughtfully** in weekly discussions, either in scheduled meetings or in Teams discussions. A significant portion of your grade depends on your timely, regular, and thorough responses to my (and your classmates’) comments in our various discussion forums. Further, your attendance may be taken based on your participation in these discussions on a regular, weekly basis.

## **Online Course Guidelines**

**For Online Courses Only (not Hybrid or Lecture Courses):**

If you are taking this course online, most of this course’s content and assignments will be delivered **asynchronously**. This means that we will not (with some exceptions) meet in “real-time,” but instead will work on a weekly schedule of lectures, writing and reading assignments, and online discussions. Each week, you will be given a checklist of items to complete. Be sure you complete them all! I have designed this course around short, hands-on assignments that will help prepare you for the longer essays. Everything you'll need to access the week's work will be linked to in the Weekly Schedule for that week.

## **Formatting Guidelines**

-   Assignment sheets are guides to reading and assignment due dates. Each student is responsible for keeping up with assignments.
-   All written work must conform to the standards of formal academic prose.
-   All assignments must conform to MLA style. Refer to your textbook for details on items such as headings, pagination, titles, and spacing.
-   Review the Temple College Student Handbook for Scholastic Integrity Policy.

## **Syllabus Disclaimer**

As the semester evolves, it is possible that changes may need to be made to the syllabus, and the instructor reserves the right to change existing policies or create new policies. Any such changes will be sent to students’ Temple College email accounts, and enforceable thereafter.
