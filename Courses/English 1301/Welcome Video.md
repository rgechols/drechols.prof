## Welcome to the Course!
- In this course, we'll be working on improving your writing, no matter where you’re coming from as a writer. Our goal is to give you a set of tools you can use in any situation to communicate as clearly and effectively as possible to a given audience, and to give you a chance to practice the collaboration and critical thinking you’ll need to succeed in the modern workplace or university. 
- To achieve that goal, you’ll be completing a series of writing portfolios that will demonstrate your ability to brainstorm, draft, review, collaborate, and revise your work in a few different genres (or types) of writing.
## About Me

## How to get in Touch
- I'm committed to being available to you throughout the semester, and I encourage you to reach out to me with any questions or concerns you may have.
- The best way to get in touch with me is through the messaging system in Teams or by email.
- I'll do my best to respond to your messages within 24 hours, though I’m usually much quicker during the work day.
# Platforms

## Course Wiki Page
-   The course Wiki is a central hub for all course materials, including the syllabus, assignment prompts, and grading rubrics.
-   You can access the Wiki through the course homepage in D2L.
-   I'll be updating the Wiki regularly throughout the semester, so be sure to check it frequently for due dates, updates, and other content.
## Teams
-   Teams is where we'll hold our class discussions and where you can ask questions and get help from me and your classmates.
-   I'll be posting discussion prompts and announcements in Teams, and I encourage you to participate actively in the discussions.
## D2L
-   D2L is where you'll be able to see your grades and track your progress throughout the course, and where you’ll access the weekly InQuizitive activities.
-   I'll be posting grades and feedback on assignments in D2L, so be sure to check it regularly.
## Weekly Workflow
-   Almost every week, you'll read guides and lectures, draft an essay, review your peers’ drafts, and make substantial revisions to your initial draft based on feedback. There will be three major essays, and a short oral presentation at the end of the course.
-   I'll provide a detailed schedule of assignments for each week in the Weekly Module page on the Course Wiki, and I encourage you to use it to plan your time accordingly.
# Assignments

## Essay Portfolios
-   Throughout the course, you'll produce three writing and revision portfolios built around three different essays.
-   Each portfolio will involve several elements, including rough drafts, peer review, revision, and structured reflection.
-   You can find prompts for these portfolios on the course Wiki under “Course Materials”.
## Declarations Quizzes
-   For every week of the class, you'll take a quiz in D2L with a short series of clear, objective statements describing your work and participation for the week.
-   For each statement, you'll indicate whether you have completed the work described or not.
-   This is an opportunity to exercise personal responsibility and track your progress throughout the course, and to reflect on your own progress. It is also a way for us both to “check in” in a low-stakes way on how you’re doing, and what you find interesting about the course material.
-   Making a false declaration constitutes a violation of Academic Integrity and will come with a blanket deduction of 50 points (or a half letter grade) from your final grade for each violation—it’s really not worth doing, as the individual questions are worth barely a fraction of that. Just be honest.
## Teams Discussions
-   We'll take time each week to check in with each other, discuss the readings or work, and our progress in achieving the course objectives.
-   You'll be assessed for the quality, depth, timeliness, and consistency of your contributions to the Teams Page each week.
-   Plan on responding at least once to two discussion threads in Teams each week (and on checking Teams regularly for updates and announcements from me).
## InQuizitive Activities
-   Norton InQuizitive is the external quizzing tool we'll be using this semester to practice and develop your grammar and writing skills.
-   You'll access the custom assignments I've made for this course through a special link in D2L.
-   You can take each activity as many times as you like, until you receive the grade you are aiming for.
-   You will need to have a code in order to use this product: access comes with the textbook, the Little Seagull ebook (which only costs $15).
## Revision Summaries

-   At the end of each major essay, you'll be asked to write a brief summary of the revisions you made to your work.
-   This is an opportunity to reflect on your writing process and to track your progress as a writer.
-   I'll provide more detailed instructions for these summaries as we approach the first essay due date, but you can find the instructions under “Course Materials” if you want to look ahead.
