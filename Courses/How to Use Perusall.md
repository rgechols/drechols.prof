## Perusall Guide:

## Overview:

Welcome to Perusall! This semester, we’ll be using this collaborative, online reading tool to complete, discuss, and respond to many of the assigned readings for the course. Perusall helps you learn faster by collaboratively annotating the readings and communicating with your classmates. Collaboration gets you help whenever you need it, makes learning more fun, enables you to help others (which research shows is also a great way for you to learn), and helps me make class better by emphasizing information that you need.

If you have a question or information to share about a passage in the readings, highlight the text and type in a comment as an annotation. You can tag me (@ReidEchols) in a comment if you have a question you need me to respond to directly. You can also respond to a classmate’s annotation in threads (Facebook-style) in real time or upvote questions you find helpful. Good annotations contribute to the class by stimulating discussion, explaining your thought processes, helping others, and drawing attention to good points. If a particular classmate’s point is relevant, you can explicitly "mention" them and they will be immediately notified, even if not presently signed on.

## How to Succeed & Earn Points:

Research shows that the following behaviors on Perusall predict higher end-of-semester grades and long term mastery of the subject. Your instructor will use these behaviors to determine your Perusall score:

- Contributing thoughtful questions and comments to the class discussion, spread throughout the entire reading (see Perusall module for examples)
- Starting the reading early
- Breaking the reading into chunks (instead of trying to do it all at once)
- Reading all the way to the end of the assigned reading
- Posing thoughtful questions and comments that elicit responses from classmates
- Answering questions from others
- Upvoting thoughtful questions and helpful answers

## Grading:

For each assignment, Perusall and I will evaluate the annotations you submit on time. Based on the overall body of your annotations, you will receive a score for each assignment. At the end of class, I will transfer your Perusall average score to the D2L gradebook as a single entry.
