### **John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley: “The Later Romantics”**

This week, we’ll be wrapping up our time with the Romantic poets by reading the poetry of John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Shelley and Keats are sometimes known as “the Later Romantics”, along with Lord Byron (whom we are not reading), because they gained prominence later than Blake, Wordsworth, and Coleridge. Both poets are interested in the relationship between art, time, and mortality: they have written some of the most powerful explorations of the theme ever produced in the English language. Their poems explore themes of beauty, love, and mortality. While both poets had their own distinct styles, their works often overlapped in their use of imagery, metaphor, and allusion. Keats' works are often described as dreamlike and lush, while Shelley's are full of power and passion. Together, the two poets created a style of poetry that has stood the test of time and is still revered today.

### Poetry & Themes

John Keats' poetry is known for its vivid imagery and exploration of themes of beauty, love, and mortality. He often used classical allusions and metaphors to create vivid, dreamlike scenes. His works are often characterized by their use of beauty and nature to explore the passing of time and the inevitability of death. Keats' poetry is also known for its use of sensuality and emotion, as he often wrote about beauty and romantic love.

Keats’ famous poem “Ode on a Grecian Urn” explores the relationship between art, time, and mortality. A prime example of ekphrasis (or describing visual art in a literary medium), the poem focuses on an ancient Greek urn decorated with a series of scenes and figures. The urn lives on long after its creators (and subjects) have died, and is in some ways “haunted” by these.

[William Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake)'s *Melancholy*, an illustration to [Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton)'s "[Il Penseroso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Penseroso)", c. 1816–1820

While Shelley’s work is very political, Keats is more interested in the intense and individual experiences of the body, and exploring the limits of mortality, consciousness, and the senses. He is particularly interested in what he calls “[negative capability](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/negative-capability)”; or the ability of art and artists to explore the darker sides of human nature, and to remain open to mystery, paradox, and the unknown. His “Ode on Melancholy” is a prime example of this: he seems keen to experience the emotional depths of sadness or grief, both as a subject for art and as a kind of extreme sport, like cave diving or free climbing, which will allow him to feel and understand things he couldn’t otherwise know.

### Poetry & Themes

Percy Bysshe Shelley's was outspoken and radical in his politics and his poetry; he claimed famously in “[A Defence of Poetry](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/69388/a-defence-of-poetry)” (1821) that poets “are the unacknowledged legislators of the world,” and you’ve already read his outspoken (though unpublished during his lifetime) attack on King George III in “[England in 1819](https://www.notion.so/England-in-1819-by-Percy-Bysshe-Shelley-bea5c8fb46744d91a89f6aa861eac4e2).”

His poem “Ozymandias” is one of his most famous works, and is a reflection on the passing of time and the futility of human ambition. The poem is written in iambic pentameter, and relates the story of a ruined monument to a forgotten king, deep in the Egyptian desert. In the poem, Shelley questions the permanence of earthly things, and reflects on the inevitability of death and the passing of time. By doing so, he may also be questioning the permanence or stability of the monarchs ruling in his own time: as evident in poems like “England 1819”, Shelley was frequently critical of the absolute power held by the crown.
