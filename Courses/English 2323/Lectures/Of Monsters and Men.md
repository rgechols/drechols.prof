Mary Shelley's classic novel *Frankenstein* is a groundbreaking work of literature in almost every sense of the word. Written in 1818 as part of a “ghost story” competition with two other Romantic writers (Percy Shelley, the author’s partner, and Lord Byron, another poet), the novel tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a scientist who creates a monster out of body parts of the dead. The novel examines the effects of scientific progress on society and the consequences of unchecked ambition. Mary Shelley was a feminist thinker and her novel has also been read as a critique of the patriarchal society of her time. She was heavily influenced by the romantic movement, but also skeptical of its excesses; Victor is very similar to the Romantic poets she spent time with, and his flaws might be meant to mirror theirs. Shelley's novel explores the complex relationship between creator and creature, and the consequences of Victor's hubris in playing God. It is a unique work of literature and has been the source of many classic horror films and books.

*Frankenstein by* [*Berni Wrightson*](http://berniewrightson.com/galleries/)* (1977/78).*

**Key things to know about the novel:**

- It draws upon myths and stories you may recognize from the first half of British literature, including John Milton’s famous poem **Paradise Lost.**
- Its subtitle comes from the myth of Prometheus, the Greek Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to mankind.
- It is an **epistolary** novel, or written in a series of letters through a frame narrator, Captain Walton, who later relates what he has been told by Victor Frankenstein, the novel’s protagonist.
- It often works through paired characters, employing both as foils or mirrors for Victor; Walton, the Monster, and Henry Clerval all are used in this way.
- The monster of the novel is **very different** from what you may have seen in popular culture or film. Pay close attention to these differences!
- One key question of the novel is, “Are monsters born, or made?” And if Victor, too, is a monster, how is he made?

Watch this video from The British Library to learn more about the Gothic mode in literature.

***Frankenstein*** is a prime example of the Gothic mode of literature, which was a popular style of writing beginning in the early 19th Century which continues to influence contemporary genres like horror, “strange” fiction, and the paranormal.

### Key Tropes of Gothic literature:

- Exotic or unusual environments or settings
- Preoccupation with death, decay, darkness
- Fascination with "forbidden" territories, realms, knowledge
- Transgressive or taboo relationships, sexual or otherwise
- The sensation of "horror" (as opposed to fear)
- Overwhelming or overruling passions; fainting, swooning, mental shock or illness; the body responding powerfully to the mind/senses
