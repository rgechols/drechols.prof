The period from 1900-1939 is a significant era in the history of British literature, marked by important social, political, and cultural changes.

### Significant Historical Events:

- The sinking of the Titanic (billed as “the unsinkable ship”) in April of 1912 became a symbol of the optimistic hubris (or pride) of the late Victorian period: the progress and productivity of Empire were not, it seemed, infallible. The high death toll, particularly among the lower class passengers, became a powerful reminder of the social and economic stratification of the age.
- The First World War, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, had a profound impact on the literature of the period, leading to a renewed focus on the experiences of ordinary people and a sense of disillusionment with traditional values.
- The “Roaring Twenties”, a period of optimism following WWI, saw the relaxation of some social and gender norms, and launched new artistic and literary movements like Jazz, Surrealism, and Modernism
- The Suffragette Movement, which had been fighting for women’s right to vote since the late 19th century. Led by activists such as Emmeline Pankhurst, the suffragettes used a variety of tactics to draw attention to their cause, including public demonstrations, hunger strikes, and acts of civil disobedience. They faced significant opposition and were often met with violence and imprisonment, but finally won limited voting access in 1918 and full voting equality in 1928.

### Important Cultural Developments:

- The questioning of traditional values and the exploration of new forms of identity, particularly in relation to the changing nature of gender, class, and race.
- New scientific and philosophical concepts published by thinkers like Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietsche, Sigmund Freud, and Albert Einstein offered revolutionary new models for understanding politics, psychology, and humanity’s place in the universe.
- The rise of popular culture in forms like the music hall, silent films, and the wireless, and the spread of mass media, which helped to shape new forms of identity and expression.
- The emergence of Jazz music, championed by Black musicians and artists during the Harlem Renaissance in America, became associated with a newfound sense of freedom and rebellion against traditional values. Jazz music was played in nightclubs, dance halls, and speakeasies, and inspired many literary artists to experiment with literary form.
- The emergence of modernism, a literary movement that challenged the conventions of traditional literature and experimented with new forms and styles.

# Thomas Hardy (1840-1928)

> “Though frequently described as gloomy and bitter, Hardy’s poems pay attention to the transcendent possibilities of sound, line, and breath—the musical aspects of language” ([***Poetry Foundation***](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/thomas-hardy)).

### Biography

## “The Convergence of the Twain” (1912)

Atlantic Liner **Titanic** ([Royal Maritime Museum Greenwich](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/rms-titanic-facts))

### Poem Introduction & Overview

- Hardy wrote this poem just nine days after the sinking of the *Titanic,* and published it a month later in the program of the "Dramatic and Operatic Matinee in Aid of the 'Titanic' Disaster Fund," given at Covent Garden Theatre in London
- The poem portrays the Titanic lying in solitude, far from human vanity and pride, with its fires cooled by the ocean currents.
- Hardy uses vivid imagery to depict the sea-worms and the jewelry now scattered on the ocean floor, emphasizing the contrast between the vanity of human beings and the indifference of nature.
- The poem casts the disaster as an allegory for the victory of Fate (or the “Immanent Will”) over human pride (”vanity”). It seems particularly odd to publish in the program for a fundraiser benefitting the victims of this disaster!

## ***The Machine Stops*** (1909)

Yvonne Mitchell played the role of the mother Vashti in this 1966 television adaptation of *The Machine Stops*, as part of a science fiction series called Out of the Unknown ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52821993)).

### Plot & Overview

- This short story is an unusual one for a number of reasons, particularly as Forster is not known primarily as a writer of science fiction. It is an early example of what we now call “dystopian” literature, imagining a future in which current human tendencies have led to a vastly different society than the one in which the story is published.
- The story is set in a distant future where humans live underground, and the surface of the earth is no longer habitable.
- People live in identical small rooms controlled by a mechanized world government, and all their needs are met by an all-encompassing machine, which anticipates many of the technologies we currently use in our own lives (including a form of social media).
- The story’s protagonist, Kuno, becomes dissatisfied with life in his cell, and begins questioning the structure and assumptions of his society.
- In the story, Forster raises questions about embodiment, technology, government, human relationships, and the environment that still resonate today.
