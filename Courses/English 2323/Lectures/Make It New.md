# Modernism & Modernity

### What is modernism?

Modernism is a literary and aesthetic movement that emerged in the early 20th century, responding to the disillusionment and destruction of the Great War and exploring the emerging complexities of human psychology and the cosmos being mapped out by scientists like Freud and Einstein. This movement impacted not only literary art, but also architecture, painting, photography, sculpture, and a host of other creative disciplines around the world: it embraced abstraction, experimentation, and the blending of forms and styles from around the world to produce new and striking effects.

In the visual arts, for example, modern painters employed a number of new “-isms”: surrealism, cubism, post-impressionism, futurism, vorticism, dadaism, etc. Each of these styles promised to express the world, not as it appears to the naked eye, but as it “truly is”, filtered through the senses, experiences, and perceptions of the human brain.

Many people take one look at modern art and declare that its “not for them”, and this is understandable. But there is often more going on than meets the eye: beneath the complexity, the difficulty, and the confusion produced by modernist art, there is often a rich and nuanced set of ideas about what it means to be human. I encourage you to read (and view) with an open mind, and to try to be patient if the “point” of the piece is not immediately apparent.

# Modernist Poetry

> “Poets in our civilization must be difficult.”

**“Difficult, various, complex”: Some defining characteristics of modernist poetry:**

- Modernist poetry is characterized by its rejection of traditional forms and structures, such as rhyme and meter, in favor of free verse and **experimental forms**.
- It often deals with themes of **fragmentation**, disillusionment, and alienation, reflecting the sense of upheaval and uncertainty that characterized the era.
- Modernist poets frequently employ unconventional syntax, punctuation, and imagery to create a sense of dislocation and ambiguity.
- Modernism claimed to be about “making it new”, and breaking with the past, but nevertheless many modernist poets relied heavily on **allusion** and **pastiche**: pulling together “fragments” (to use Eliot’s term) of both high and low culture to produce startling juxtapositions: **The Waste Land,** for example, includes references to Shakespeare, Dante, and Chaucer alongside songs from the music hall and the sounds of a pub at closing.
- Modern poetry is “**difficult**” because it had to reflect a difficult, and increasingly complex, human experience: as [this article](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/152025/an-introduction-to-modernism) points out, “Thinkers such as Darwin, Nietzsche, Marx, Freud, and Einstein changed people’s understanding of history, economics, philosophy, science, psychology, physics, and even religion.”

**Significant modernist poets:**

- T.S. Eliot is perhaps the most famous modernist poet, known for his highly influential long poem The Waste Land, which embodies many of the features we have just discussed.
- Ezra Pound was another leading figure in the movement, famous for his Imagist poetry and his advocacy of "making it new" in literature.
- H.D. (Hilda Doolittle) was a prominent female modernist poet who often drew on classical mythology and imagery in her work.
- William Butler Yeats was an Irish poet, playwright, and political activist who drew heavily on both Irish and Greek mythology to explore the violence and conflict of the 20th Century

### ***The Waste Land*** (1922)

[A short introduction to Eliot’s The Waste Land by Dr. Oliver Tearle of Loughborough University.](https://youtu.be/PSI5AejsFbU)

A short introduction to Eliot’s The Waste Land by Dr. Oliver Tearle of Loughborough University.

**Poem Introduction & Overview**

*The Waste Land* is a groundbreaking modernist poem by Eliot, published in 1922. The poem is known for its rich imagery, symbolism, and references to various works of literature and philosophy. It deals with themes of fragmentation, disillusionment, and alienation, reflecting the sense of upheaval and uncertainty that characterized the era following WWI. *The Waste Land* is a challenging read, but it is also deeply rewarding for those who are willing to put in the effort to understand it.

The poem is broken up into five sections, or “movements”, each with its own title:

- The first section, "The Burial of the Dead," introduces themes of death, decay, and emptiness, but also of rebirth. It features a series of disjointed, fragmented images and voices, including the famous line "April is the cruellest month."
- The second section, "A Game of Chess," is a conversation between two people that reveals their dissatisfaction and lack of connection with each other. It also includes references to Shakespeare's "The Tempest" and other literary works.
- The third section, "The Fire Sermon," is full of references to unfulfilling romantic encounters, and explores themes of desire, longing, and loneliness. It also includes a reference to Buddha's Fire Sermon.
- The fourth section, "Death by Water," is a brief, almost haiku-like meditation on the transience of life.
- The fifth and final section, "What the Thunder Said," includes a mix of voices and images from various cultures and religions, suggesting that no one worldview or belief system can fully capture the complexity of modern life. It ends on a note of ambiguity and uncertainty.

**Difficult, Various, and Complex Indeed!**

This is (quite intentionally, on Eliot's part) a BEAST of a poem. One of the most notoriously tricky, challenging, and complex pieces of poetry written in the last century or so. But fear not! The edition linked in Perusall has links embedded into many of the more unfamiliar passages, so you should be able to click to find translations, notes on references, etc. Here are some tips for first-time readers:

- Don’t get too hung up on any one line or phrase: try reading through the poem, out loud, and just let it wash over you. Then you can go back to the sections that most stand out to you.
- Remember to use your close reading skills to look for allusions, patterns, and other stylistic features of the poem.
- Keep in mind that the poem is delivered in many different “voices”: there are many speakers here, and they aren’t labeled or introduced. Imagine you’re overhearing a whole city, including people who are talking to themselves, and you aren’t far wrong.

**Key Influences/References in the Poem:**

Try watching the short introduction video included here, and see if you can recognize any of the following references in the poem:

- The Rape of Philomela, from Ovid's *Metamorphoses*
- Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales* ("When April with its showers sweet...")
- Dante's *Inferno*
- Arthurian Legend (Tristan & Isolde, the Fisher King)
- Shakespeare (*Hamlet*, *The Tempest*, *Antony & Cleopatra*)
- James Joyce's *Dubliners* (stories of everyday life, characterized by alienation, misunderstanding, and paralysis.)
- William Blake's poem "London" ("I wander thro’ each charter’d street, / Near where the charter’d Thames does flow")
- Charles Dickens (original title of the poem was "He Do the Police in Different Voices", a line from *Our Mutual Friend*, and the structure of the poem mirrors *A Christmas Carol*).
- Christian Scriptures (Christ, the walk to Emmaus, St. Augustine, Easter)
- Buddhist/Eastern Philosophy (Buddha's Fire Sermon, the *Upanishads*).

### Poem Overview: “The Second Coming”

![Untitled 4.png](Courses/English%202323/Lectures/Make%20It%20New.assets/Untitled%204.png)

Icelandic gyrfalcon, 1759 ([Wikimedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrfalcon#/media/File:M%C3%A5lning,_Isl%C3%A4ndsk_jaktfalk,_1759_-_Livrustkammaren_-_89009.tif))

**“The falcon loses the falconer…”**

- "The Second Coming" is a powerful and haunting poem that speaks to the turbulent political and cultural landscape of the early 20th century, though its message has resonated with many apocolyptic moments over the years. Yeats uses vivid and symbolic imagery to evoke a sense of foreboding and apocalypse, suggesting that a new era is about to emerge from the destruction of the old.
- One key symbol in the poem is the "rough beast" that "slouches towards Bethlehem to be born." This image is often interpreted as representing the rise of fascism or other totalitarian movements that were gaining strength in Europe during Yeats's time. However, the poem's title also alludes to the biblical Book of Revelation, which describes the end of the world and the second coming of Christ.
- What do you think Yeats is suggesting about the future of Ireland and the world in this poem? How does he use imagery and symbolism to convey his message? What connections can you draw between "The Second Coming" and Yeats's other poems in this collection, such as "Easter, 1916" and "An Irish Airman foresees his Death"? How do these poems reflect Yeats's engagement with the political and cultural issues of his time?

### Other Yeats Poems

**Overviews & Introductions**

- "The Lake Isle of Innisfree" paints a peaceful picture of a rural retreat, providing a stark contrast to the chaotic world of Yeats's other poems. The speaker expresses a desire to escape to a simpler life, away from the pressures of modern society.
- In contrast, "Easter, 1916" and "An Irish Airman foresees his Death" are both political in nature, addressing the turbulent politics of early 20th century Ireland. In "Easter, 1916," Yeats reflects on the failed Easter Rising, which sought to establish an Irish Republic. In "An Irish Airman foresees his Death," Yeats explores the conflicted motivations and mindset of an Irish airman fighting for the British during World War I (in effect serving the Empire that the Irish sought independence from).
- "Leda and the Swan" is a mythological poem that tells the story of Zeus's seduction of Leda in the form of a swan. The poem uses vivid and often disturbing imagery to convey the power dynamic between the two characters, as well as the violent consequences of their encounter.

In your view, what unites these poems? What themes and motifs do they share, and how do they differ in their style and message? How do they reflect Yeats's engagement with the political and cultural issues of his time, and what insights do they offer into the human condition more broadly?
