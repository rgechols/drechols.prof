## The Victorian Age

This week we’ll be entering [the Victorian period](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/read/british-literature-ii-part-2/section/66de981d-fd7c-4279-b703-620bb7328548), which roughly spans the reign of Queen Victoria (1837-1901), and which saw unprecedented expansion of British power and wealth through the twin engines of industrialization and global colonization. It also saw advances in science— including the discoveries of geologist Charles Lyell and naturalist Charles Darwin—which challenged longstanding religious understandings of humanity’s place in the so-called “natural order.”

## A Time of Social Change
The Victorian period was also marked by great social change, with the rise of labor movements and the women’s rights movement. This was a time of religious tension, with the Anglican Church attempting to maintain its power and influence in the face of new, secular forms of thought (including Darwinian science and new understandings of how old the world truly is).

The literature of the time explored these tensions, and addressed the growing social unrest that accompanied the economic expansion of Industry and Empire. Important authors of the time, such as Charles Dickens, Alfred Tennyson, and Robert Browning, wrote works that explored the social issues of the day, often featuring characters of all classes and backgrounds. They often commented on morality, religion, and the human condition, and challenged traditional values.

## Robert Browning (1812-1889)

Robert Browning was an English poet and playwright. He was one of the most prominent figures of Victorian literature and is best known for his dramatic monologues, such as "My Last Duchess" and "The Bishop Orders His Tomb at St. Praxed's Church." Browning was born in Camberwell, London, and his father was a bank clerk. He studied at the University of London and traveled in Europe, where he met and befriended fellow poets Elizabeth Barrett and Alfred Tennyson. Browning married Elizabeth Barrett in 1846, and they eventually settled in Italy, where Browning wrote some of his most famous works. He died in Venice in 1889.

## Dramatic Monologues

Browning is well-known for his dramatic monologues, which are poems that take the form of a conversation with an absent or imaginary person. These monologues often feature a protagonist who speaks to the reader directly, revealing his or her innermost thoughts and feelings. In these works, Browning explores the complex inner lives of his characters and delves into the motivations behind their actions. His monologues also often comment on broader social issues and critique the values of Victorian society.

## “My Last Duchess”

One of Browning's most famous monologues is “My Last Duchess.” The poem is told from the point of view of the Duke of Ferrara, who is speaking to an envoy from a potential marriage partner. The Duke reveals his possessive and controlling nature as he reminisces about his deceased wife, the "last Duchess," and her "faults" that he found intolerable. Through the Duke's words, Browning may be critiquing the Victorian values of male dominance and marital subjugation.

## “Porphyria’s Lover”

Another of Browning's prominent works is “Porphyria’s Lover.” This monologue follows a mysterious speaker as he recounts his relationship with Porphyria, a woman he loves but suspects does not return his affections. The poem closes with the man describing how he strangles Porphyria and then watches her die. Browning paints a sympathetic portrait of the madman, exploring notions of guilt, love, and despair. Through this poem, Browning may be exploring themes of mental illness and the dangers of obsession. He may also be suggesting that the desire to control or possess women (evidenced in both speakers from the poems above) is a trait that often leads to violence.

> For there is no friend like a sister
In calm or stormy weather.

—*Goblin Market* (562-563).

Christina Rossetti was an English poet and author, best known for her poem, "Goblin Market." She was also a major figure in the Pre-Raphaelite movement and wrote devotional poetry, children's poetry, and religious poems. Rossetti was born into a family of poets, including her brother, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and her mother, Frances Rossetti. She was educated at home by her mother and was an avid reader, writing poetry throughout her life.

## A Tale of Temptation
One of Rossetti's most famous works is the 1862 narrative poem, *Goblin Market*. The poem follows two sisters, Laura and Lizzie, as they are tempted by the goblins of the titular market, who attempt to lure them with their delicious fruits.

*Goblin Market* is one of the most famous poems about Victorian morality, particularly as it applied to women. In telling this story of two sisters—one who gives into temptation, and one who resists—Rossetti constructs an **allegory**, or a narrative designed to represent a moral or ethical principle beyond its literal meaning. But because of its rich and memorable language, the poem has taken on a life of its own: readers can't seem to agree on what the allegory truly is!

## A Puzzling Poem

Rossetti's poem has intrigued and perplexed readers for ages—is it simply "a fairy story," or is it a moral fable, "a little spiritual drama," or something else? In her [introduction to this poem for The British Library](https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/an-introduction-to-goblin-market), Dr. Dinah Roe explores the formal, biographical, and critical contexts of this remarkable and mysterious poem, pointing out that it has been interpreted in numerous ways: as "a warning about the dangers of a free-market economy, a protest against hazardous practices in 19th-century food-adulteration, a Christian tale of sacrifice and salvation, a parable of lesbian empowerment, a fable about anorexia, an expression of incestuous yearning and a tribute to the delicious oral and aural pleasures of poetry itself."

The poem’s rich imagery lends itself to illustration; from Rossetti’s brother, the pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti, to famous 20th century illustrator Arthur Rackham, many artists have offered their take on the poem.
