### Overview & Themes

- The First World War (known in Britain as “The Great War”) lasted from 1914 to 1918, and had a profound impact on British society, politics, and literature.
- Unprecedented death tolls, the paralysis of trench warfare, and the clear contrast between the optimism of nationalist propaganda and the horrors of modern combat led to a vast **dissillusionment** with the power structures in place before the war: “God, King, and Country” lost much of its shine after the loss of nearly an entire generation of young men to the war.
- Industrialized warfare (including machine guns, artillery, and mustard gas) saw vast losses on even a single day of a battle: almost 20,000 British soldiers died on the first day of the Battle of the Somme alone. The total number of British military casualties was over 880,000, or 6% of the adult male population.
- Many soldiers were conscripted, or forced to fight, as recruitment dwindled at the end of the war. This experience led to many individuals feeling like cogs in a deadly machine: unable to control their own fate, and at the mercy of a cruel state. This feeling would make itself known in many of the literary movements following the war, like Modernism, which emphasized individual experiences and subjectivity over the political and moral themes preferred by the Victorians before the War.

### Writing the War Experience

- British poets responded to World War I with a sense of disillusionment and horror at the reality of modern warfare.
- Many poets, such as Wilfred Owen, wrote about the brutal nature of trench warfare and the suffering of soldiers on both sides of the conflict. These poems were rendered even more powerful by the fact that many of their authors were soldiers themselves, and several (like Owen) died in combat.
- Others, such as Rupert Brooke and Jessie Pope, wrote about the glory and honor of dying for one's country, though this perspective was largely rejected by later poets as the war dragged on.
- British poets responded to World War I with a profound sense of loss and the belief that the world had been irrevocably changed by the conflict.

Overview of the manuscript revisions Owen went through while writing “Dulce Et Decorum Est” (The British Library)

### “The old lie”

- "Dulce et Decorum Est" has become one of the most celebrated anti-war poems in the English language, combining masterful use of poetic diction with vivid, disturbing imagery (listen for all those harsh vowel sounds in the opening stanza, and think about what they do to your throat as you read: it almost feels as if the poem is trying to choke you as you read).
- The poem describes the horrors of gas warfare and the toll it takes on soldiers, and contrasts this experience with the upbeat patriotism of recruitment posters (or poems like Jessie Pope’s “The Call” below).
- The title of the poem comes from the Latin poet Horace, the full translation of which is "It is sweet and fitting to die for one’s country." Note that Owen argues exactly the opposite: look for the words “bitter” and “profane” near the end.
- Owen wrote the poem to counter the pro-war propaganda of his time and to reveal the true nature of war to his readers. He tragically died shortly after writing it, only a few months before the end of the War.

### “Who’s for the trench?”

- Jessie Pope was a poet and journalist who wrote in support of the First World War and encouraged young men to enlist in the military.
- Her most famous poem is "The Call," which was written in 1915 and emphasizes the honor and duty of serving one's country.
- The poem was written in 1915 to encourage men to enlist in the war effort.
- The poem is written in a conversational tone, with the narrator addressing the reader directly.
- The narrator uses a series of rhetorical questions to encourage the reader to enlist (or shame them for wavering).
- The poem emphasizes the honor and glory of serving one's country, and suggests that those who do not enlist are cowards or shirkers.
- A manuscript of Owen’s “Dulce et Decorum Est” originally included the epigraph: “For Jessie Pope”

### Women in Wartime

- Women played a vital role both on the home front and on the front lines of the First World War, despite having been denied the right to vote in the Suffragette protests of the pre-war years.
- Women were involved in various activities, such as nursing, factory work, and agricultural labor, among others, and their efforts were vital in supporting the war effort. Their roles in these industries helped bring more women into the workforce, offering increased mobility, independence, and awareness of the limitations of their previous position in society.
- Some women, like Mary Borden, served with distinction in the dangerous war hospitals located behind the lines in France and Belgium. This work required courage, discipline, and great fortitude: the wounded came in massive waves (a metaphor Borden often uses) as a result of the nature of modern warfare.
- Many social and political changes occurred as a result of women's participation in the war, including the expansion of women's suffrage and increased opportunities for women in the workforce.
- Women's roles in society were redefined by the War, even though there was substantial pressure for things to return to “normal” after the hostilities ceased.

### Votes for Women

- Suffragettes were activists who campaigned for women's right to vote in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
- After facing great resistance from the government and men in positions of authority, many believed that peaceful protest was not enough to achieve this goal and often engaged in more radical tactics like vandalism, arson, and hunger strikes.
- The suffragette movement in Britain was led by women like Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Christabel and Sylvia.
- The movement gained significant attention and support from the media and the general public, but also faced strong opposition from the government and many members of society.
- The largest Suffragette organizations decided to cease their activism during the War, in the interest of national security. Many suffragettes volunteered for service in the factories and hospitals left vacant by the men sent to the front.
- The suffragette movement was ultimately successful in achieving women's right to vote in 1918 in the UK, but it was not until 1928 that all women over the age of 21 were granted the right to vote.

### Borden’s Wartime Memoir

- *The Forbidden Zone* (1929), from which “Blind” is taken, is a collection of short stories and poems that Borden wrote during the war. Inspired by her experiences in the field, Borden's work is known for its unflinching portrayal of the horrors of war, particularly the physical and emotional toll it takes on soldiers and medical personnel alike.
- Borden's writing is deeply critical of the propaganda and nationalism that fueled the war effort, and is often seen as a precursor to the anti-war writing that would become popular after the conflict. The collection includes stories of soldiers in the trenches, as well as the nurses who cared for them. Borden's work explores the physical and emotional trauma of war, and the ways in which it affects individual soldiers and their relationships with one another.
- Her writing is characterized by its vivid, visceral descriptions of the realities of war, and her willingness to confront uncomfortable truths. The stories in "The Forbidden Zone" are powerful and moving, and offer a unique insight into the experiences of those who lived and died during the Great War. Borden's work remains an important contribution to the literature of war, and a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of unimaginable hardship.
