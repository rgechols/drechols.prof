Trailer for ***The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari*** (1920), a German silent film that Woolf saw immediately before writing ‚ÄúThe Cinema‚Äù.

**Before the ‚Äútalkies‚Äù:**

- The silent film era in Britain lasted from the late 1800s to the late 1920s.
- Films were typically accompanied by live music and sound effects (a professional musician would often play the piano, or even create live effects like the sound of thunder, etc.).
- The films often featured exaggerated acting and simple storylines, though many actors and directors used the limitations of the genre to great effect.
- They relied heavily on visual storytelling since there was no spoken dialogue.
- This era is considered by many to be a golden age of cinema, as filmmakers experimented with new techniques and created some of the most iconic films of all time.
- Woolf‚Äôs comments in ‚ÄúThe Cinema‚Äù are directed at films like **The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari**, which she had just seen in 1926.

üí° One of the greatest British actors of all time is **Charlie Chaplin**, a master of physical comedy who honed his skills in the silent film era:

**Modernist Fiction looks at Modern Film**

- Virginia Woolf wrote this essay after seeing what is now a classic horror film, ***The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari*** in 1926***************************.*************************** The experience led her to question how this emerging art form might change how we tell (and listen to) stories: as we know from ‚ÄúModern Fiction‚Äù, Woolf was particularly concerned with this question.
- Woolf recognized the importance of cinema in providing an escape from the mundane and in celebrating the beauty of ordinary life, even while acknowledging that the medium was often used for crass commercial purposes.
- Woolf believed that the best films were those that told stories in a visually and emotionally compelling way, and that challenged viewers to think critically about the world around them.
- Woolf saw a few potential **benefits** or strengths of the film medium:
   - Cinema is an art form that could transcend language and cultural barriers, possessing a unique ability to convey emotion through visual and auditory means.
   - Cinema could have a democratizing effect, allowing people from different backgrounds and classes to share a common experience and to see the world in new ways.
   - As such, there was a potential for cinema to be used as a tool for social and political change,
- She also saw several **problems** or liabilities with the genre:
   - She criticized Hollywood films for being shallow and formulaic, and for perpetuating harmful stereotypes.
   - She also anticipated the use of film for propaganda, or the influencing of the masses through misinformation or emotional manipulation

**Documenting Labor & Culture**

- As the cinema emerged as a form of popular entertainment, it was also seen as a powerful political and educational tool: the thirties saw an explosion of documentary films from directors like John Grierson (considered by many to be the ‚Äúfather‚Äù of modern documentary film) covering all aspects of English life and labor: from fishermen in the Scottish sea to factory workers in the Industrial north of England. Grierson believed the purpose of documentary was "to make the working man the hero of the screen‚Äù.
- This film, **Night Mail**, was directed by Harry Watt and Basil Wright for the British General Post Office, and incorporated words by W. H. Auden, a famous English poet. The section you‚Äôll watch is at the very end, though [you can watch the whole thing here](https://www.travelfilmarchive.com/item.php?id=13899). The film follows Grierson‚Äôs principles rather closely: making the humble postal worker an almost epic figure.
- As you watch, think about why filmakers like Grierson, or public entities like the Post Office, might want to use the power of the cinema to tell stories that hadn‚Äôt been told before, particularly about working-class citizens.
- How do you see Auden‚Äôs words, the visual images, and the soundtrack working together? Can you think of parallels from today‚Äôs media?

- He is often referred to as the "Master of Suspense" for his ability to create tension and suspense in his films.
- Hitchcock is known for his distinctive visual style, which often includes the use of carefully crafted camera angles and shots.

## ***The Lady Vanishes*** (1938)

Alfred Hitchcock's *The Lady Vanishes* is a classic example of his mastery of suspenseful filmmaking. Set against the backdrop of pre-World War II Europe, the film tells the story of an English woman who mysteriously disappears from a train, and the subsequent investigation by her fellow passengers.

Beyond its thrilling plot and direction, *The Lady Vanishes* is also notable for its portrayal of British national character. The film presents a cast of characters who are distinctly ‚ÄúBritish‚Äù in their sensibilities and demeanor, from the reserved and polite Miss Froy to the bumbling cricket enthusiasts Charters and Caldicott. Through these characters, Hitchcock offers a commentary on the state of British society in the years leading up to the war, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses.

**Questions to consider:**

- How does Hitchcock use English characters like Miss Froy, Charters, and Caldicott to portray British national character?
- What strengths and weaknesses of British society are highlighted in The Lady Vanishes?
- How does the portrayal of British society in The Lady Vanishes reflect the time period in which it was made?
