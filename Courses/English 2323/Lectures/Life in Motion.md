*The Boulevard Montmartre at Night*, by Camille Pissarro (1897) from [The National Gallery](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/camille-pissarro-the-boulevard-montmartre-at-night).

> "Why, if one wants to compare life to anything, one must liken it to being blown through the Tube at fifty miles an hours—landing at the other end without a single hairpin in one's hair!.... Yes, that seems to express the rapidity of life, the perpetual waste and repair; all so casual, all so haphazard.”

> —Virginia Woolf, “The Mark on the Wall”

**Introduction to Modernist Fiction:**

- Modernist fiction emerged in the early 20th century as a response to the rapidly changing urban landscape and social environment of the time.
- Modernist writers often focused on the experiences of individuals living in cities, exploring themes such as alienation, anonymity, and disconnection from nature.
- The use of experimental literary techniques, such as stream-of-consciousness narration, fragmentation, and non-linear storytelling, was a hallmark of modernist fiction.
- Some of the most prominent modernist writers include James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, T.S. Eliot, and William Faulkner, who are known for their innovative approaches to form and their exploration of the human psyche.
- While it was still a very male-dominated field, many women writers found their voice writing fiction for the many magazines and literary journals of the time, including Woolf, Katharine Mansfield, Gertrude Stein, Djuna Barnes, and Jean Rhys.
- Modernist fiction was also characterized by a rejection of traditional literary conventions and a desire to break free from established literary traditions.
- The impact of modernist fiction continues to be felt today, with many contemporary writers still drawing inspiration from the themes, techniques, and ideas explored by modernist writers.

![Untitled 2.png](Courses/English%202323/Lectures/Life%20in%20Motion.assets/Untitled%202.png)

The cover for ***The Common Reader*** (1925) designed by Woolf’s sister Vanessa Bell. “Modern Fiction” was published in this collection, though it first appeared in the ***Times Literary Supplement*** as “Modern Novels” in 1919.

**Overview & Introduction**

- Virginia Woolf's essay "Modern Fiction" was published in 1919 (originally under the title “Modern Novels”, and is considered one of the most important articulations of the aims and methods of modernist fiction (though there were many writers, like Joyce and D. H. Lawrence, who disagreed with her on a number of points).
- Woolf calls for a new form of fiction that better reflects the complexity of modern life.
- The essay argues that writers should move away from traditional narrative structures and instead focus on the inner lives of their characters.
- She criticizes the traditional realist novel (which she identifies with “Bennett, Galsworthy, and Brown”, all popular novelists at the turn of the century) for its reliance on plot and external events.
- Woolf cites the works of James Joyce and Anton Chekhov as examples of the new style of fiction that she believes is necessary to capture the complex layers of modern life and consciousness.

### “Kew Gardens”

*Still Life on Corner of a Mantelpiece,* by Vanessa Bell, 1914. [Tate Gallery](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bell-still-life-on-corner-of-a-mantelpiece-t01133).

**Overview & Introduction**

- "Kew Gardens" is a short story by Woolf, first published in 1919.
- The story uses a non-linear, impressionistic style, which emphasizes sensory impressions and subjective experience over narrative structure.
- The story takes place in the Kew Gardens botanical gardens in London, and follows a group of characters as they wander through the gardens on a summer afternoon.
- The narrative focuses on the characters' thoughts and experiences, rather than on a traditional plot or storyline. We follow the threads of conversation as we might if we were in the garden ourselves, or perhaps if we were the snail the narrator points out, sliding lazily along a leaf.
- Using experimantal literary techniques like tream-of-consciousness narration and indirect interior monologue, "Kew Gardens" offers a vivid and evocative portrayal of the characters' inner lives and the sensory experience of the gardens themselves.

### “The Mark on the Wall”

***The Snail*** by Henri Matisse, 1953. [Tate Gallery](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/matisse-the-snail-t00540).

**Overview & Introduction**

- "The Mark on the Wall" is a short story by Virginia Woolf, first published in 1917.
- The story is narrated from a first-person perspective and is structured as a stream-of-consciousness narrative.
- The narrator observes a mark on the wall and reflects on the nature of perception and the relationship between the physical world and the world of thought.
- She remarks on a number of seemingly trivial or disconnected phenomena, including potential references to WWI, daily life, and domestic relationships. The only thing connecting many of these phenomena is the thinker/seer herself, suggesting that perspective is often what shapes perception, instead of the other way around.
- Like “Kew Gardens”, the story explores the inner workings of the human mind through experimental literary techniques, such as [free indirect discourse](https://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/wlf/what-free-indirect-discourse) and the use of interior monologue.

## James Joyce (1882-1941)

**Biography & Overview**

- James Joyce was an Irish novelist and poet, born in Dublin in 1882, though he would have a vexed relationship with his homeland for his entire life. His early novel, ***A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*** captures his frustration with the conservative, provincial Catholicism of turn-of-the-century Ireland.
- He is considered one of the most important and influential writers of the 20th century, and is famous for his highly experimental style and attention to the psychological and social fabric of everyday modern life.
- His most famous works include *Ulysses*, an experimental novel that takes place over the course of a single day in Dublin, and *Finnegans Wake*, a complex and difficult work that pushes the boundaries of language and meaning. One of his first successful works was ***Dubliners*** (1914), a collection of connected short stories focused on individuals living in Dublin.
- Joyce's writing had a profound influence on the development of modernist literature and continues to be celebrated for its experimental style and its exploration of important social and cultural issues.

Epiphany & Paralysis: ***Dubliners* and the modern city**

- *Dubliners* is a collection of 15 short stories by James Joyce that offer a glimpse into the lives of Dublin's middle-class residents in the early 20th century. The individual stories stand on their own, but are connected thematically.
- Joyce's use of **epiphany**, a sudden moment of insight or revelation, is a key feature of the stories and helps to illuminate the characters' experiences and emotions.
- The theme of **paralysis**, or the idea that the characters are trapped in their mundane lives and unable to escape their circumstances, is also a recurring motif in the stories.
- The collection is divided into three sections, with the first stories focusing on childhood, the middle stories on adolescence and young adulthood, and the final stories on middle age and death. “Araby” is from the first section, and “Eveline” from the second; both depict moments of realization and lost innocence in the context of childhood and adolescence, respectively.
- *Dubliners* is considered a foundational work of modernist literature and a milestone in the development of the short story as a literary form, both in style and in subject matter.

### **“Araby”**

"Araby" follows a young boy living in Dublin who becomes infatuated with his friend Mangan's sister. He promises to buy her a gift at the Araby bazaar, a local carnival, but is ultimately disappointed when he arrives too late and the bazaar is closing. Embarrassed, the narrator realizes not only that his efforts have been in vain, but also that Mangan’s sister will never reciprocate his affections (which he is only just beginning to understand himself). "Gazing up into the darkness,” he says, “I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger."

The story explores a number of issues surrounding what it means to grow up: as we get older, we often realize that things that were immensely important to us hardly mattered to anyone else; we also realize that the world may see us very differently than we see ourselves.

### **“Eveline”**

"Eveline" focuses on a young woman who is contemplating leaving her mundane life and abusive father in Dublin to start anew with her lover in Buenos Aires. However, as she prepares to leave, she becomes overwhelmed with feelings of duty towards her family and guilt for abandoning them. The story ends with her ultimately deciding to stay in Dublin, caught between the desire to escape and the uncertainty of leaving everything behind.

This decision is complicated by the knowledge that Buenos Aires was known at that time as a place where women were often kidnapped and sold, so it is unclear what her lover’s motivations might be here. We can never know, but this does force us to recognize the real uncertainty Eveline faces in her decision. She is stuck, Joyce seems to suggest, with no clear path or wholly attractive options, largely due to her society’s attitudes towards women.
