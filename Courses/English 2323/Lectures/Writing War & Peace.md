## World War II in British Culture & Film

World War II was a defining moment in the history of the world, and its impact was felt in all aspects of society, including literature. British literature during this period reflected the experiences of the war and the resulting social and cultural changes. The literature of this era encompasses a wide range of genres, from poetry to novels to films, and reflects the struggles and triumphs of the British people during a time of great upheaval. The literature of World War II provides a powerful lens through which to view one of the most tumultuous periods in modern history.

- After a period of great poverty and economic hardship following the end of WWI and the Great Depression, Germany was torn by political conflict and rising populist movements. The 1930s saw the rise of Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist (Nazi) party in German politics, along with a rise in anti-minority sentiments and demonstrations.
- In 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and Britain and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of World War II. Initially, the war was fought mainly in Europe, with Britain providing support to France and later joining the fight against Germany after the fall of France.
- The 1930s were a period of **appeasement** in Britain, with the government led by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain seeking to avoid another war with Germany after the devastation of World War I. The appeasement policy was based on the belief that Germany's demands, such as the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland, could be satisfied without the need for war.

## Winifred Holtby‚Äôs ‚ÄúTruth is Not Sober‚Äù (1933)

### Author Bio & Overview

[A lecture on Holtby‚Äôs life and work from the [Hull History Centre](https://www.hullhistorycentre.org.uk/research/research-guides/winifred-holtby.aspx). ]([https://youtu.be/S31Kd0dwQ30](https://youtu.be/S31Kd0dwQ30))

A lecture on Holtby‚Äôs life and work from the [Hull History Centre](https://www.hullhistorycentre.org.uk/research/research-guides/winifred-holtby.aspx).

- Winifred Holtby was born on June 23, 1898, in Rudston, Yorkshire, England. She was the daughter of a farmer and the first female alderman (a kind of city councillor) in Yorkshire.
- She was among the first classes of women allowed to graduate from the University of Oxford, and became a teacher, journalist, and novelist. She published many short stories, articles, and novels before her premature death in 1936.
- Holtby was an active feminist, socialist, and pacifist and was involved in many political causes, including women's rights and peace movements.

## Story Contexts & Overview

- Holtby‚Äôs short story ‚ÄúTruth is Not Sober‚Äù,  a kind of fable, depicts Truth as an inebriated character outraged that a writer ("the Realist") has been praised by his readers for telling "the sober truth" about life.
- In a turn of events reminiscent of Dickens' *A Christmas Carol*, Truth shows the Realist the error of his ways, taking him on a journey of discovery both at home and abroad. While the Realist is used to writing about everyday, practical topics (like domestic life and middle-class economic problems), Truth wants to show him that the world is much more strange, dramatic, unpredictable, and tragic than his novels seem to realize.
- Through this story, Holtby (a journalist herself) seems to be remarking ironically on how out-of-touch the average British reader is with the earth-shaking events taking place both around the world and in their own backyards.
- The story alludes to a number of historical and seemingly contradictory events, like the rise of both Adolf Hitler in Germany and Mahatma Ghandi in India, that no "sober" historian or politician might have predicted. See if you can identify a few of these historical references in your comments.
- If this story is a kind of allegory, or a narrative designed to symbolically represent a deeper truth, what do you think Holtby is trying to say about the following topics?
   - The ways in which middle class prosperity might blind us to important things happening both at home and abroad
   - The idea that we prefer stories that follow a predictable pattern, even though life is rarely predictable
   - The irony that we have access to more information than ever before (through the news, the wireless, etc.) and yet are unable or unwilling to internalize it or let it affect our lives
   - The idea that the truth is often stranger than fiction, and that this is actually a problem for how we write (and read) fiction

üí° Holtby‚Äôs story may be read in some ways as criticizing the wishful thinking behind the political logic of appeasement: many thought it simply wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúlogical‚Äù for Hitler to pursue the course of action that he took, and it took a very long time for British and American citizens to accept that attrocities like the Holocaust were indeed taking place. ‚ÄúTruth is Not Sober‚Äù seems to suggest that the desire to see ‚Äúlogic‚Äù in the world (and in our fiction) can often mislead us from seeing what is truly there.

## Virginia Woolf, ‚ÄúThoughts of Peace in an Air Raid‚Äù (1940)

## Historical Background

- The Blitz, a sustained bombing campaign by the German Luftwaffe against British cities and towns, began in September 1940 and lasted until May 1941. The Blitz caused significant damage to British infrastructure and killed thousands of civilians, but failed to break the morale of the British people.
- To protect themselves from the Blitz, the British government implemented a range of measures, including the construction of air raid shelters and the evacuation of children and other vulnerable groups to the countryside. The government also established the Home Guard, a volunteer force of civilians trained to defend their local communities in case of invasion.

## ‚ÄúThoughts on Peace‚Äù Overview

- Woolf‚Äôs essay, written shortly before her death in 1940, takes place during an air raid and reflects on the anxieties and fears of those who endured the bombings.
- Woolf contemplates what it means to be at war and how violence and destruction affect individual and collective psyches. She also argues that the root causes of the war are not solely nationalistic: rather, she sees the violence of the Nazis reflected in the larger, systemic violence of the patriarchy.
- Written to an American audience, Woolf‚Äôs essay seeks to build solidarity with American women not only in working towards peace, but also in fighting the patriarchal and abusive structures, the drive to violence and domination, that lead to all wars of conquest.

## Strand Films (and Dylan Thomas), **Our Country** (1944)

‚ÄúDylan Thomas: A Poet at War‚Äù from [BBC Wales](https://www.cwmnida.cymru/en/portffolio/dylan-thomas-a-poet-at-war/)

### Film Overview

- Strand Films, a British film production company, produced a number of propaganda films during World War II, including "Target for Tonight" (1941), a documentary about a British bomber crew, and "Western Approaches" (1944), which dramatized the efforts of the Royal Navy in protecting Atlantic convoys from German U-boats. ‚ÄúOur Country‚Äù is another example of these wartime films, though it stands out for having a script written by poet Dylan Thomas.
- This film was made for both British and American audiences, and is notable for having its script written by famous Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. It blends documentary, drama, and poetry to depict what life is like in wartime Britain. While the now-famous saying "Keep Calm and Carry On" is not featured directly in the film, you can very much see the sentiment at work.
- The film uses the documentary principles of other thirties films, following the ‚Äúeveryman‚Äù sailor as he moves across the nation and visits its working people. The film is designed to praise the heroic spirit of British citizens during the war, and to evoke solidarity from American audiences.
- [You can view the manuscript for this film here](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll98/id/2558), at my former place of employment (where I first came across this fascinating film).

## Historical Background

- Britain received significant military and economic support from the United States, which entered the war in December 1941 after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The British-American alliance, along with the contributions of other Allied nations, eventually led to the defeat of Germany in May 1945. Wartime films and propaganda often sought to increase ties and foster friendship between the countries, particularly since there was a strong isolationist movement in the US (and, alarmingly, even some sympathies with the racist and antisemitic actions of the Nazis in the segregated South).
