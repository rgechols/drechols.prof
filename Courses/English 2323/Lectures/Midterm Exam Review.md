# Midterm Exam Review

Tags: Exam Prep

## Overview

Your exam will take place in D2L, through an online quiz.

- You will have until the closing date to complete the exam.
- There is no time limit, and you are allowed to consult your notes, readings, and the lectures in answering questions.
- You will see a selection of multiple choice and multiple select questions (in randomized order), and a randomized Close Reading question with a selection of quotes to choose from.

Keep in mind that, for the multiple select questions, there may be many "right" answers. You will receive points for any correct selections that you make. These questions are designed to employ your critical thinking and reading skills, and not to be easily "Googleable".

There will be two randomly selected bonus questions at the end of the exam.

You will be able to see your score on the objective questions immediately after submitting the exam, but the Close Reading section will be graded manually (so do not panic when you see the initial score).

## Reading Skills & Critical Thinking

(75 points)

The first section will test your knowledge of the texts we’ve read in this half of the course, and your ability to use critical thinking to identify major themes, ideas, or concepts. You will see 15 questions, randomly ordered and selected from a larger question bank. They will be worth 5 points each.

### Multi-Select Questions

Many questions will be “multi-select” rather than multiple choice. This means that there may be multiple correct answers, and that you should select any answers that apply. You will get points for any correct selections (or for correctly not selecting incorrect answers).

**For Example:**

❓ **Select the social and political concerns most associated with the Romantic period (you may select more than one):**

- [ ] the rights and dignity of common people
- [ ] revolution and civil unrest
- [ ] rational order and carefully-observed social hierarchies
- [ ] religious orthodoxy and loyalty to the Church of England
- [ ] Exploration, travel, and social exchange

## Close Reading (Essay) Question

(25 points)

You’ll see a randomly selected prompt offering you a choice of several quotes from across our readings so far. You will select one of the quotes, and complete a **Close Reading** of that selection, labeling and following each step of the close reading process (Paraphrase, Observe, Contextualize, Analyze, Argue). You should write at least a paragraph for each step. No need for a formal introduction or conclusion.

**For example**:

❓ Select one of the quotes below, identify the **title** and **author** of the text that the quote appears in, and then perform an analytical **close reading** of the text, using the five steps of the close reading process (Paraphrase, Describe, Contextualize, Analyze, Argue). Be sure to indicate which quote you are selecting, and to explain in the paraphrase step where in the text the selection appears.

In your argue step, you should explain the **significance** of the quote to the overall meaning of the text in which it appears: what central themes, ideas, or concerns from the larger text are evident in the quote?

*There is no word limit or minimum, but it is unlikely that a complete answer could be given in under 500 words.*

📝 **********************Quote 3: from “Ode on Melancholy” by John Keats**********************

   [**Paraphrase**] This passage appears towards the end of the poem, when the poet is describing the shrine of Melancholy, which he has personified as a kind of goddess. In these lines, he is specifically discussing…

   [*Observe*] Notable formal features of these lines include examples of personification, metaphor, and repetition. For example…

   [*Contextualize*] Relevant contexts for this poem might include the author’s biography. For example…

   **[*Analyze*] Drawing on this evidence, we begin to see how the poet uses the language of the poem to deliver a particular impression of what melancholy means, and how one should experience it. For example…

   [*Argue*] Based on this analysis, we might make a larger argument about the poem’s significance as an example of Late Romantic poetry. Keats personifies Melancholy in order to help the reader understand how a poet ought to relate to the emotion; not as something to be escaped, but as an experience to be embraced. This might connect with Keats’ concept of “negative capability”, which suggests…
