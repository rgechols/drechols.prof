## **Key Elements of British Romanticism**

---

> “Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.”

—Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ***The Social Contract*** (1762)

### What is **Romanticism?**

---

ℹ️ An artistic, philosophical, and literary movement begun in the late 18th century emphasizing powerful emotions, spontaneity, subjectivity, the natural world, and the importance of individual experience.

- Emerges as a **response** to the Enlightenment and Neoclassical aesthetics (which emphasized structure, rationality, order, and hierarchies), and to the political energy released by the French & American Revolutions.
- Involves the radical idea that the **individual** is the most important unit of society: individual rights, liberties, and experiences become more important than social hierarchies or religious/political power structures.
- Prioritizes “**the natural**”: both the natural world (trees, mountains, weather) and human nature (genuine emotion, authentic everyday speech).

### Questioning the Enlightenment

**The Shortcomings of Reason**

Romantic poet and artist William Blake here depicts a great hero of the Enlightenment, Sir Isaac Newton, as a simultaneously heroic and tragic figure: he works on his proofs by the light of reason, but he is only able to see immediately in front of him. Meanwhile, he is surrounded by the vast darkness, depth, and beauty of the ocean, all unnoticed.

Reason, to the Romantics, was like a candle: it illuminates what’s in front of us, but also blinds us to the darker, deeper, often more powerful elements of both the natural world and the human psyche. Romantic poets (along with writers in the Gothic mode) were interested in what lies beneath the surface: the passions and undercurrents of human consciousness.

### Seeking the Sublime

**Looking Out to Look In**

By contrast, this highly Romantic painting from German artist Caspar David Friedrich places us behind its subject, looking out over a powerful and shrouded landscape. Romantic poets sought out such vistas in the Swiss Alps and English Lake District, hoping to evoke powerful emotions to fuel their poetry. In many ways, they “looked out” in order to “look in”: the important subjects for art were nature and individual experience (and most importantly, the relationship between both of these).

See Wordsworth’s “I wandered lonely as a cloud,” or “The world is too much with us” for some examples of this.

> *One impulse from a vernal wood
May teach you more of man,
Of moral evil and of good,
Than all the sages can.*

—from ”The Tables Turned”, ***Lyrical Ballads*** (1798)

### Biography

- British poet & critic who lived from 1770 to 1850.
- One of the founders of the Romantic movement in English literature, along with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
- Wordsworth is famous for his love of nature and his use of everyday language in his poetry.
- Some of his most famous works include "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" (also known as "Daffodils") and "The Prelude," an autobiographical poem.
- His sister Dorothy was one of the great early nature writers: her notebooks contain brilliant and vivid descriptions of the natural life and landscapes of the Lake District

### ***Lyrical Ballads*** (1798)

Originally published anonymously in 1798, *Lyrical Ballads* featured poems from Wordsworth and his friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Readers found the first poem, Coleridge’s *Rime of the Ancient Mariner*, so confusing that Wordsworth suggested moving it to the end of the second edition, and wrote a new preface to help explain what the book was doing to new readers. In doing so, he ended up writing what would become one of the core “manifestoes” of Romantic poetry.

### Wordsworth’s “Preface” to **Lyrical Ballads** (2nd ed.)

**Common Life & Common Speech**

In his preface to the second edition of "Lyrical Ballads," published in 1800, Wordsworth argues for a shift in poetry, away from the ornate and artificial language of the 18th century and towards a more “natural” and simple style. He asserts that poetry should be drawn from and reflect the "real language of men" and “the essential passions of the heart.”

Wordsworth also emphasizes the importance of **common subjects** in poetry, arguing that they should be given equal attention as grand and lofty themes. He states that poetry should be accessible to all people and not just the educated elite.

He also stresses the role of **emotion** and **imagination** in poetry, stating that a poet should attempt to reproduce the feelings and thoughts that arise from the common occurrences of life. In contrast to the highly structured and artificial verse forms of the preceding century, Wordsworth argues that poetry should be a medium for the expression of "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings."

Overall, Wordsworth's preface amounts to a kind of early manifesto for Romantic poetry, and has had a significant impact on the Romantic movement and the course of English literature ever since.

> “The principal object, then, proposed in these Poems was to choose incidents and situations from **common life**, and to relate or describe them, throughout, as far as was possible in a selection of **language really used by men**, and, at the same time, to throw over them a certain colouring of **imagination**, whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual aspect; and, further, and above all, to make these incidents and situations interesting by tracing in them, truly though not ostentatiously, the **primary laws of our nature**: chiefly, as far as regards the manner in which we associate ideas in a state of **excitement**.”

—”Preface” to *Lyrical Ballads*, par. 6

### “A selection of language really used by men”

Wordsworth emphasized the use of common speech in poetry, advocating for a shift away from ornate and artificial language. He argued that poetry should be drawn from and reflect the "real language of men" and “the essential passions of the heart”, using a language easily understood by all people, not just the educated elite. He sought to capture the feelings and thoughts that arise from the common occurrences of life, and believed that poetry should be a medium for the expression of "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings."

**Shifting away from “artifice” and “ornament” in language:**

Here is an example of the kind of poetry Wordsworth wanted to get away from, the ornate and elevated diction of a poet like John Milton (who wrote two centuries earlier). Ironically, many of the Romantics quite liked Milton, but this poem is a good example of the artifice that many wished to avoid.

> Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more

> Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere,

> I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude,

> And with forc'd fingers rude

> Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.

> Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear

> Compels me to disturb your season due;

> For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,

> Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer.

> Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew

> Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.

> He must not float upon his wat'ry bier

> Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,

> Without the meed of some melodious tear.

—John Milton, “[Lycidas](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44733/lycidas)” (1638), first stanza

See the archaic (or deliberately “old-fashioned”) diction? “O ye laurels,” etc.? Take, by contrast, these lines from Wordsworth’s “The World is Too Much With Us”:

> The world is too much with us; late and soon,

> Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—

> Little we see in Nature that is ours;

> We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!

—Wordsworth, “The World is Too Much With Us” (1-4)

The diction is simpler, and the words are less complicated. The poet is trying to be as direct and plainspoken as he can (though to modern ears he may still sound somewhat flowery).
