During the Industrial Revolution, child labor became a prevalent issue in Britain. The new factories and mines required simple tasks that could be performed by children, leading to a surge in child labor. Research has shown that the average age at which children started work in early 19th-century Britain was 10 years old, but that this varied widely between regions. In industrial areas, children started work on average at eight and a half years old. Most of these young workers entered the factories as piecers or scavengers. In the mines, children usually started by minding the trap doors, picking out coals at the pit mouth, or by carrying picks for the miners. Rural children tended to start work later while in towns, most boys were employed as errand boys or chimney sweeps. All children labored for very low pay, performing work that was dirty and dangerous, and usually working long hours as well. This marked a break with traditional practice, and was something that some contemporaries found distasteful. It triggered a series of parliamentary inquiries into the working conditions of children in mines and factories. This issue was also explored through literature, in works such as ‘”The Cry of the Children” and *A Christmas Carol*, by Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Charles Dickens, respectively.

Elizabeth Barrett Browning was a prominent Victorian poet who gained recognition for her romantic and deeply personal poems. Born in 1806, Elizabeth began writing poetry at a young age, and her works were widely acclaimed for their emotional depth and lyrical beauty. She is best known for her collection of love poems, *Sonnets from the Portuguese*, which she wrote for her husband Robert Browning. The poems in this collection are widely regarded as some of the most beautiful and heartfelt expressions of love in the English language.

In addition to her work as a poet, Elizabeth Barrett Browning was also a social activist who wrote frequently about the injustices of her time. She was particularly concerned with issues related to child labor and slavery, and her poetry often reflected these concerns. Her poem "The Cry of the Children," for example, is a powerful indictment of the exploitation of children in the factories and mines of Victorian England.

Despite her success as a poet, Elizabeth Barrett Browning faced numerous challenges throughout her life. She suffered from a chronic illness that left her bedridden for years, and she also had to contend with the social norms of her time, which often limited women's opportunities and achievements. Nevertheless, she continued to write and publish throughout her life, and her work remains a testament to the power of poetry to inspire and uplift the human spirit. Elizabeth Barrett Browning died in 1861 at the age of 55, but her legacy as one of the greatest poets of the Victorian era lives on.

## “The Cry of the Children” (1843)

---

Barrett Browning was shocked to learn of the appalling conditions facing children working in the mines and factories after reading an 1842 parliamentary report on the subject.  Since she believed that “ethical poetry is the highest of all poetry forms” (qtd. in [British Library article](https://www.bl.uk/works/the-cry-of-the-children)), she naturally began to apply her poetic gifts to raise awareness and advocate for reforms.

“The Cry of the Children” addresses the plight of child laborers in Victorian England, comparing them to cogs in the wheel of industrial machinery. The poet uses wheel imagery as a metaphor for the children's struggle to survive and denounces a system that considers young lives to be merely a means to economic progress.

The poem uses the second person (addressing the reader directly as “You”) to implicate readers in the issue and appeal to their ethics and fellow-feeling. Browning contrasts the sight of "the young lambs bleating in the meadows" with the reality of children working in coal mines and factories, and appeals to readers to take responsibility for the children's suffering. Like Blake, she suggests that the suffering of innocents condemns the nation that allows it to continue: “the child’s sob curseth deeper in the silence / Than the strong man in his wrath!” (158-159).
