This week we will explore the tensions, conflicts, and negotiations between **belief** and **doubt** in the Victorian imagination. In an age shaped by rapid changes, expansion, violence, discovery, and injustice, Victorian writers had to contend with conflicting ideas of what it meant to be human: where moral virtue had been (and in many ways continued to be) determined primarily by the orthodoxy of organized religion, competing claims about the relationship of humans to the world were beginning to emerge. Where the story of Genesis suggested that humans (and particularly men) had “dominion” over the natural world, emerging scientific evidence suggested that we were in fact a much, much smaller part of an increasingly unfriendly cosmos.

Two major sets of discoveries began to raise questions about the literal truth of the Christian religion, particularly concerning the account of Creation in the Book of Genesis, which placed humans at the top of the natural hierarchy. The discoveries of **Charles Darwin**, which suggested that species evolve over time based on genetic traits geared towards survival, and **Charles Lyell**, a geologist whose work proved that the earth was much, much older than the 6,000 years suggested by a literal interpretation of the Bible, caused many to question humans’ place in the world.

All of the poets we’ll read for this week explore questions of religious faith, doubt, and the natural world. Gerard Manley Hopkins' works "As Kingfishers Catch Fire" and "The Windhover" are religious poems, exploring themes of faith and doubt, with references to God, Christ, and the Church. In both poems Hopkins meditates on how the power of God is reflected in the beauty of creation. Alfred Lord Tennyson’s poems, however, taken from a longer piece reflecting on the death of a beloved friend, explore the tension between nature’s violence and inscrutability and the supposed existence of a loving God. Finally, Matthew Arnold’s famous poem “Dover Beach” reflects on the shifting values and priorities shaping British culture towards the end of the Victorian period.

Alfred Lord Tennyson was a British poet and one of the most popular writers of the Victorian era. He was Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom from 1850 until his death in 1892. Tennyson is best known for his long narrative poems such as *The Lady of Shalott* and *Idylls of the King*, but he also wrote shorter lyric poems, many of which are included in his work *In Memoriam, A.H.H.*

## **In Memoriam, A.H.H.** (1850)

1851 Edition of ***In Memoriam***, Wikimedia Commons.

Alfred Lord Tennyson's work *In Memoriam, A.H.H.* is a collection of poems mourning the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam. The work is known for its exploration of themes of grief, faith, doubt, and the search for meaning in the face of loss. The book was published in 1850 and is considered one of Tennyson's most important works.

Key tensions in this work include:

- Tension between faith in God and grief at the loss of a beloved friend
- Tension between seeking comfort in Nature (as a Romantic might) and seeing its more violent, Darwinian tendencies (”red in tooth and claw”)

Gerard Manley Hopkins is considered one of the greatest and most innovative poets of the Victorian era, though his work was not fully recognized until after his death. He was a Jesuit priest and his religious beliefs were a major influence on his poetry. In his religious poems, Hopkins often meditates on the power of God and His presence in the world. He explores themes of faith, doubt, and the relationship between God and humanity. He also reflects on the beauty of creation and how it reflects God's power. In all of his work, Hopkins grapples with the tension between religious faith and the discoveries of science in the Victorian era.

## “The Windhover”

Hopkins’ sonnet, “The Windhover” is one of his most beloved and bewildering poems. The poem is known for its complex structure, unusual meter, and blending of love for the natural world with religious piety. In the poem, Hopkins describes a bird of prey, the windhover, soaring through the sky. He marvels at the bird's grace and beauty, and sees in it an image of God's power and majesty. The poem is often considered a meditation on the relationship between the divine and the natural world (not unlike William Blake’s “The Tyger”).

## “As Kingfishers Catch Fire”

This poem (another sonnet) similarly explores the relationship between religious faith and the beauty of nature. In the first stanza, Hopkins describes the unique beauty of individual creatures, and the idea that “Each mortal thing does one thing” (line 5): essentially broadcasting its selfhood out into the world. In the second stanza, he connects this individuality with a common, Divine source: the near-infinite expressions of creation, all unique, are facets of the creator. This idea might, however, beg the question that Blake frequently asks: what of the darker, more destructive facets of this creation?

# Matthew Arnold (1822-1888)

Matthew Arnold was an influential British critic and poet. Often called “the most Modern of the Victorians”, Arnold was particularly attuned to the rapid changes brought about by the Victorian era. His poetry frequently explores themes of loss and longing: he often saw individuals as being swept up in the vast, inhuman forces of the nineteenth century (like cogs in the massive machines of Empire, or workers in the factories).

## “Dover Beach” (1867)

![Untitled 7.png](Courses/English%202323/Lectures/Victorian%20Faith%20&%20Doubt.assets/Untitled%207.png)

In "[An Introduction to the Victorian Era](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/153447/an-introduction-to-the-victorian-era)", the editors of *Poetry Foundation* point out that, "More than a century and a half after its publication, “Dover Beach” remains a durable expression of Victorian poetics: its intricate patterning and stagy theatrics, its nostalgia for simpler times, and its uncertainties about an increasingly mechanized modernity." Where the first two poets we’ve read for this week attempt to reconcile religious faith with the realities and uncertainties of a changing world, Arnold seems to suggest that this reconciliation may be impossible: like fighting the inexorable tides he describes lapping on Dover Beach in the poem.

This is not an entirely hopeless poem, though: he seems to suggest that human relationships are even more vital than ever as the “Sea of Faith” recedes. He exhorts, “let us be true / To one another!” even as he suggests that, at the end of the nineteenth century, we find ourselves caught up in forces and events beyond our control.
