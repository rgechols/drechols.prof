# Overview

For this assignment, you will construct an **original literary critical argument** about one or more of the texts we have read this semester. You should incorporate plenty of textual evidence (quotes and examples from the story/song/play/poem itself), in addition to careful research into the topic, context(s) and author you have selected. Your essay should center around a clear, well-defined thesis statement, and be structured in an organized, deliberate manner. The sources you employ should be both carefully-selected and explicitly connected to your central argument. A significant part of your grade in this assignment will depend on your thorough participation in (and reflection on) a guided peer review and revision process.

****Note that without participating in peer review and completing a Revision Summary with your Final Draft, the highest grade possible will be a B.**

# Objectives

-   Develop an original literary critical argument about one or more texts read during the semester, employing the close reading process to analyze its meaning and significance
-   Incorporate textual evidence and research into the topic, context(s), and author(s) selected
-   Employ carefully-selected and explicitly connected secondary sources to support the central argument
-   Thoroughly participate in a guided peer review and revision process
-   Reflect on and describe the peer review and revision process in a substantial Revision Summary

# Specifications

-   A minimum of 1,100 words of polished, clear, and organized prose
-   MLA formatted document, header, in-text citations, and Works Cited Page
-   12pt. font, double-spaced, standard margins, Word .doc or PDF file.
-   A minimum of 5 secondary sources—in addition to the primary text(s)—cited in the essay and listed in the Works Cited page. These sources should come from the Temple College Library databases or collections. You may use additional outside sources.
-   A clearly-defined thesis, making an arguable interpretive claim about your literary text(s), and establishing the stakes of your project (why it is important).
-   Several body paragraphs that each focus on a single example, idea, or furthering claim related to the thesis.
-   A concise but thought-provoking conclusion that sums up and reflects upon your argument: tell us what you have proved or demonstrated here, and why it might matter.
-   A substantial [Revision Summary](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Write-a-Revision-Summary-f8afe4375b2047cfa040b9137b37d55d), included on its own page after the Works Cited page, 350-500 words long, describing and reflecting upon your peer review and revision process. It should _describe_ the feedback you received from your peer(s), _explain_ the specific steps you took to evaluate and revise the draft on your own, and _reflect_ on what you have learned about your own writing process as a result.
-   Final draft, Works Cited page, Revision Summary, and Rough Draft turned in as a single document to the D2L Dropbox by the due date.

# Tips

-   Read the prompt, rubric, and the guides below closely, and more than once.
-   Be sure that your thesis is an argument, not simply an observation (see [How to Write a Literary Critical Thesis](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Write-a-Literary-Critical-Thesis-c9875e598c8d4613a0d3b5ef6f782758) for some strong/weak examples).
-   Be bold in your claims! No need to qualify things with "it seems like" or "it is possibly the case that" etc. [Be concrete, confident, and concise](https://www.notion.so/18a5f071a2b247bbad1f4a981f59e64d).
-   Be sure that when you cite a source or give an example you also _introduce_ and _explain_ it: no quote left behind! See [How to Incorporate Quotes](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Incorporate-Quotes-c74c3529b1cc48389dfed900dc514cc3) for more tips.
-   Be sure to use the close reading process to ensure that your claims about the text are well-founded. See [How to Close Read a Text](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Close-Read-a-Text-41934cb1b9134e109b36429610939663) for more information.
-   Be sure you revise **carefully** and **substantially**: even if your peer does not give you many suggestions (this happens, sometimes), take the initiative to make your essay as strong as it possibly can be. The [How to Revise a Draft](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Revise-a-Draft-7735c21a5281411ba5a433c2203af327) guide can help, here.
-   Try using a resource like Grammarly (or the Writing Center, a peer, parent, or friend) to add some eyes to your draft and identify any typos, grammar issues, or missing citations. Remember that content is more important than form, though.

# Grading Rubric

Here is the rubric on which your work will be assessed. Note that it focuses on your work, revision, research and participation in the revision _process_ as much as it does on the finished _product_. For each question below, if the answer is “yes” you earn 30 points; “mostly” earns 25; “partially” earns 15; “no” earns 0. [150 points total available.]

-   [ ] Did you turn in a **complete** and **grammatically correct** essay by the deadline, meeting all of the specifications above, containing few/no grammatical or stylistic errors, and conforming to MLA formatting and style guidelines (including a title, header, correct margins, and Works Cited page)?
-   [ ] Does your essay have a clear central **thesis**, communicated in the first paragraph and supported throughout the essay, that puts forward an arguable interpretative claim about the meaning ****and importance ****of the text(s) you’re examining, and does the **structure** of your essay logically develop this thesis using clear transitions, topic sentences, and an introduction/conclusion?
-   [ ] Do you use several concrete, relevant **examples** or quotes from both your primary literary text(s) and from reputable scholarly and background sources, and are these examples incorporated effectively (i.e. introduced, attributed, cited, and thoroughly explained)?
-   [ ] Does your essay demonstrate careful **************************close reading************************** of the texts you’re discussing, including relevant contexts, literary devices, formal features, and careful **analysis** of how these contribute to the meaning of the text being discussed?
-   [ ] Did you participate fully and productively in the peer review, revision, and reflection process? A “yes” would mean that you have turned in your rough draft on time, participated fully in peer review, and included a complete and thorough [Revision Summary](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Write-a-Revision-Summary-f8afe4375b2047cfa040b9137b37d55d) to show that you have thought carefully about your peer’s feedback, the assignment prompt, and what you’ve learned in the class in making your revisions.
