- After the withdrawal of the Roman legions, Germanic tribes (the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes) began a series of successive invasions of Britain
- Tribes were originally Pagan, but converted to Christianity after missionary efforts from Ireland and Rome began in 597. Literature often presents a fusion (and/or tension) between the two religions
- Common themes include battle, fate (or “[wyrd](https://www.notion.so/AI-Notepad-45cba4aaffb047c2b47f14756a7d9fe8?pvs=21)”), feats of strength or bravery, and kinship (tribal or family loyalty)
- Pre-Christianity, Anglo-Saxon poetry was oral, so any written records come to us filtered through the Christian chroniclers like Bede

## Anglo-Saxon Poetry

Distinctive features of Anglo-Saxon poetry include:

- Alliteration - repeated sounds, most frequently “hard” consonants (consonance)
- Kennings - compound metaphors, like “whale-road” for “sea”
- Caesura - A strong pause in the middle of a line, creating a rhythmic structure
- Lack of rhyme - repetition replaces end rhyme as a primary sound device
- Epic form - Longer poems took the form of epics centered on heroes and national mythic history, like _******Beowulf******_
- Stressed syllables: a typical line includes 4 stresses, 2 stresses each separated by a caesura or pause

## Kinship & Kings

Anglo-Saxon society was built around tribal and family loyalty.

- Aristocratic, heroic, and tribal social structure
- Groups defined not by geography but by kinship
- Kings or chieftains led households of warriors or retainers, and reward loyalty with the spoils of battle
- Loyalty and vengeance are two sides of the same coin: retainers were obliged to avenge their lord’s death or die trying
- This obviously conflicted with later Christian principles of forgiveness and loyalty to faith over family

## Riddle Games

## Saga hwaet ic hatte (Say what I’m called)

> When I am alive I do not speak.
> 
> Anyone who wants to takes me captive and cuts off my head.
> 
> They bite my bare body
> 
> I do no harm to anyone unless they cut me first.
> 
> Then I soon make them cry.

> My home is not quiet but I am not loud.
> 
> The lord has meant us to journey together.
> 
> I am faster than he and sometimes stronger,
> 
> But he keeps on going for longer.
> 
> Sometimes I rest but he runs on.
> 
> For as long as I am alive I live in him.
> 
> If we part from one another
> 
> It is I who will die.

### Group Work

- Review [these Anglo-Saxon Riddles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9Q06UbakoQmezBkLbvpZySDJow0E5VBVNfY7qWqD7k/edit?usp=sharing) in groups and see if you can guess the answers
- Collaborate to write your own riddle in the style of the Anglo-Saxon riddles
    - Do your best to follow the 4-stress meter/pattern (two stresses, pause, two more stresses).
    - Incorporate at least 3 instances of consonance (repeated consonant sounds)

### Debrief

- Why do you think riddles were so popular for Anglo-Saxons? What cultural or social purpose do they served?

## Post-Class Activities

- Be sure you have the textbook
- Read the first half of Beowulf (lines 1-835)
