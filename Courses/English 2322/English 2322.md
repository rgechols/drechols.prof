### **Welcome to Class**

I’m very excited to work with you this semester. Know that I’m here to help however I can, and that the best way to get that help is to ask. If this is your first college course, or your first one in a while, that's great! The main thing to know is that, in this class, **you are responsible for your own learning.** This **syllabus** is a kind of contract between us: it says what I’m committed to providing for you as an instructor, and outlines what I will expect from you as a student. I want [all of my students](https://www.notion.so/Equity-Inclusion-Statements-08d9f04822054c1d93495fc5da1322b1?pvs=21) to succeed, and am [committed](https://www.notion.so/Student-Accommodations-cbe1aa54033141d1a3922b51102fd4d0?pvs=21) to helping them do so. I am also happy to help connect you with [other resources on campus](https://www.notion.so/Resources-for-TC-Students-705c796f7e0047849f7bb822200053a6?pvs=21), which include tutoring, library and research assistance, tech support, the Writing Center, financial assistance, and mental health support, among other things.

**A Note on Assessment:**

In grading your work, I promise to be as honest, transparent, and fair as I can be. Each assignment is designed to help you become a better reader, writer, and critical thinker, and as such I will look for growth and improvement as much as I will for content. That said, remember that this is a college course. Standards are high, and "A" is not a default score. I am happy to discuss your grades, but if you wish to do so, make sure you read the assignment prompt, the rubric, and any comments from me carefully beforehand.

**A Note on Dual Credit and Numerical Grades:**

As far as Temple College and most other institutions of higher education are concerned, letter grades are all that matters. There is typically no difference between 90% and 100% on a college transcript: both are simply an "A." If you are in a Dual Credit course, and the difference in points within a particular grade range is important to you for your high school GPA, note that it is **very difficult** to get above the equivalent of a 90% in this (or any) college course. **To get a higher numerical grade, you will have to go above and beyond the basic requirements of the course (and may be given optional challenging activities to help you do so).**

## Assignments

---

This course is designed around a combination of seminars, workshops, collaborative research, and lectures. You should expect to engage actively in each class session. You will be assessed in a variety of ways, including regular quizzes on lectures and readings, frequent writing and reflection prompts, group and individual presentations, and an extended scholarly digital research project.

|Norton InQuizitive|Interactive online quizzing tool provided by the publisher. Due on the last class day of each assigned text indicated in the schedule.|
|---|---|
|Weekly Quizzes|Regular quizzes through D2L combining at least one objective question with one short essay prompt. Designed to test your knowledge of the concepts, terms, and ideas discussed during that week’s classes.|
|Teams Page Discussion & Collaboration prompts|Daily prompts designed to prompt discussion, organize our knowledge, and share thoughts on the readings. Will be assessed cumulatively (and holistically) at the end of the semester for quality, frequency, and depth of participation.|
|Group Film Adaptation Presentation|Students will sign up for one of three film adaptations assigned throughout the semester, and complete a group research and close reading project to analyze the cultural connections between the source text and contemporary society.|

## Attendance & Late Work

---

### **Attendance**

🖥️ For Online or Hybrid Classes:

In online courses all attendance will be taken based on the timely completion of weekly assignments. If you do not turn in work, you will receive a zero for the assignment(s) and be counted absent for the corresponding class sessions. Students may be withdrawn from the course on their 3rd absence if it is before the drop date. After 3 absences, 2 points will be deducted from your final average for each absence.

🙋🏽 For In-Person Classes:

Attendance will be taken daily, usually through some form of short assignment, activity, or written work. It is your responsibility to be both **physically** and **mentally** present in class: failure to do either may result in you being marked absent for the day, or losing credit for daily work. Missing more than the maximum number of class days can lead to you failing or being dropped from the course—and will almost certainly result in a lower overall grade, practically speaking.

If at any time you realize that you cannot complete the course, it is **your** **responsibility** to drop the course. Check the [Temple Academic Calendar](https://www.templejc.edu/calendar/academic/) for the last day to drop a class for the semester you're in. If you do not do so by that date, you will receive a failing grade.

### **Late Work/Make-Up Policy**

In general, you may not make up any quizzes, discussion posts, or other daily work. There are few exceptions, so be sure you complete your weekly assignments with plenty of time to spare. If extenuating circumstances arise, you are responsible for contacting me in advance to make any necessary arrangements.

All assignments are due by 9 PM on the due date, per the assignment instructions. Any work submitted after that time will not be accepted for credit, unless you have arranged an extension with me at least 72 hours before the due date.

You are responsible for ensuring that you have a stable internet connection, access to D2L, and reliable technology for completing and submitting your assignments. Technological difficulties will not be accepted as an excuse for missed work.
